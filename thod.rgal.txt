Мандала thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor, "Мандала Переможного Бінду" або "Мандала Запечатаної Квінтесенції")
з циклу klong chen snying thig ("Сутність Обширного Простору") має прямий зв'язок із візіями
thod rgal ("прямий перехід"), зокрема з найпростішою п'ятихрестовою мандалою тіглє,
відомою як mnyam pa'i sdom pa ("хрест рівного смаку" або "збалансований хрест"). Цей зв'язок виникає
з езотеричної структури вчень Дзогчену в традиції Ньїнґма, де thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor слугує
фундаментальною попередньою практикою, що готує практикуючого до візійного досвіду thod rgal.
Нижче детально пояснюється цей зв'язок із посиланням на текстовий і практичний контекст циклу klong chen snying thig.

1. Контекст thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor у klong chen snying thig

klong chen snying thig є важливим циклом Гонтер, відкритим Рігдзіном Джігме Лінгпою (1729–1798)
через чисті видіння Лонгчен Рабджама (1308–1364). Цей цикл синтезує попередні лінії Дзогчену (наприклад,
Віма Нінгтік і Кхандро Нінгтік) і наголошує на найвнутрішнішій сутності (snying thig) остаточної
довершеності (rdzogs pa chen po).

thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor (повна назва: bla sgrub thig le'i rgya can, "Запечатана Квінтесенція:
Найсекретніше Досягнення Гуру") є найвнутрішнішою секретною практикою лами (bla ma'i sgrub thabs) у цьому
циклі. Вона зосереджується на гуру як втіленні первісної свідомості (rig pa) і описується як "скарб розуму"
(dgongs gter), який Джігме Лінгпа приховував у своєму серці протягом п'яти років перед його відкриттям.

Ця практика не є окремим ритуалом, а незамінною попередньою практикою (sngon 'gro) до Дзогчену, що слугує
мостом між стадіями породження та завершення Ваджраяни й прямим введенням у rig pa. Вона включає візуалізації
світлих бінду (thig le, "краплі" або "точки світла"), які представляють п'ять мудростей (ye shes lnga)
та відповідні їм елементи й кольори.

2. Мандала thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor

Мандала thig le rgyal mtshan gyi dkyil 'khor є тонкою, світлою діаграмою, центрованою на переможному бінду,
що символізує єдину сутність (ngo bo) гуру (часто візуалізованого як Лонгченпа або Падмасамбхава).
Вона характеризується:

* Центральним синім А-бінду (a thig le sngon po), що представляє первісну чистоту (ka dag) і дгармакаю (тіло істини).
* Променями або ланцюгами світла ('od 'phreng) п'яти кольорів (синій, зелений, червоний, білий, жовтий), що випромінюються з бінду, формуючи хрестоподібну структуру.
* Ця конфігурація втілює "збалансований хрест" (mnyam pa'i sdom pa), просту геометричну форму, де чотири периферійні
  сфери (що представляють чотири напрями та елементи: земля/жовтий, вода/білий, вогонь/червоний, вітер/зелений)
  оточують центральну сферу (простір/синій), усі об'єднані в збалансованій світності ('od gsal).

Мандала з'являється в посвятах (dbang) і садханах (sgrub thabs), складених пізнішими майстрами,
такими як Джам'янг Кх'єнце Вангпо (1820–1892), який розширив її під час видінь у Гангрі Тхокар (скит Лонгченпи).
Вона зображена в наборах тханок klong chen snying thig, часто як одна з 12 основних діаграм.

3. Візії thod rgal і п'ятихрестова мандала тигле

thod rgal є візійною фазою Дзогчену, що слідує за khregs chod ("розсікання твердості"),
де спонтанні свічення ('od snang) виникають як прояви динамічної енергії (rtsal) rig pa.
Ці візії прогресують через чотири стадії (snang ba bzhi):

* Пряме сприйняття реальності (chos nyid mngon sum): Початкові тигле (маленькі світлі сфери).
* Зростання досвіду (nyams gong 'phel): Розширені візерунки, включно з ланцюгами та хрестами світла (Тіглє Г'ялчен).
* Кульмінація свідомості (rig pa tshad phebs): Мандали божеств і елементів.
* Вичерпання явищ (chos nyid zad pa): Розчинення у веселкове тіло ('ja' lus).

"Найпростіша мандала тіглє" (thig le'i dkyil 'khor shin tu spros bral) у thod rgal — це mnyam pa'i sdom pa,
хрестоподібна конфігурація бінду, що виникає на другій стадії. Вона символізує:

* П'ять чистих свічень ('od lnga) або мудростей, розташованих у рівновазі "рівного смаку" (mnyam pa'i ro), вільній від дуалістичного аналізу.
* Основу еманації (sprul pa'i gzhi), де кольори, елементи ('byung ba lnga) і напрями інтегруються як цілісність поза розділенням.

Ця фундаментальна візійна форма часто з'являється як сяючий хрест із центральним синім
тіглє (простірами) в оточенні чотирьох кольорових тіглє, що мерехтять, мов веселка, у полі зору під час
споглядання небо або відлюдному темному ретриті.

klong chen 'od gsal snying thig/ mig gi snying sgron/ Сердечна Лампа Бачення

Практика Тогалу (thod rgal) є глибоко візуальною, а її візії розгортаються у спосіб, що є плинним,
органічним і надзвичайно прекрасним. Щоб бути по-справжньому відкритим до наміру
Сутності (ngo bo'i dgongs pa), втіленого в цій плинності та красі, необхідно ясно
бачити світло у своєму серці очима серця (snying gi mig). Більшість людей дозволили
своєму розуму домінувати і використовують очі у звужений, тунельний спосіб, сліпо
хапаючись через негативні емоції (nyon mongs pa) та обмеження окремої ідентичності,
підтримувані розумом (позитивні і негативні тенденції).

Канал світла ('od gsal gyi lam), що у практиці Тогалу безпосередньо з'єднує очі з серцем,
обходить мозок і його контроль над тим, що ми бачимо. Однак, якщо
не відійти від вузької, неконтрольованої хапальної дії розуму шляхом відкриття серця,
візії Тогалу все ще проходитимуть через розум і не розгортатимуться автентично.

Очі мають природну плинну силу, яка простягається назовні і з'єднується з тим, що вони бачать.
Ця сила може зустрічати, утримувати, штовхати або притягувати за потреби. Якщо ця сила керується
розумом, вона хапає і затягує назад до себе, інтерпретуючи побачене у спосіб, що підсилює
сприйняття, які підтримують окрему ідентичність. Однак очі також можуть використовуватися
чистіше, від серця, для з'єднання і взаємодії. Завдяки цьому більш відкритому використанню
очей виникають візії, і ви встановлюєте з ними зв'язок. Відмовившись від хапання очима,
бачення стає взаємним обіймом: ви обіймаєте візії, а вони обіймають вас.

Плинна, сприйнятлива природа очей та їхня здатність сприймати світло називається Сердечною
Лампою Бачення (mig gi snying sgron). Природна плинна сила очей простягається назовні
і з'єднується з тим, що воно бачить, і тому іноді називається Водяним Ласо (chu'i zhags pa).
Завдяки цьому більш відкритому використанню очей ви зливаєтеся і єднаєтеся з візіями,
коли вони виникають. Тоді якість ласо стає взаємним обіймом, коли ви обіймаєте візії, а вони обіймають вас.

klong chen 'od gsal snying thig/ thod rgal gyi mdog gsal gyi snang ba/ Радіантні кольори Тогал

Сяйво Сутності (ngo bo'i gzi brjid, Тиб. ngo bo) охоплює все Буття; немає нічого, що не виникало
б із потенціалу Сутності. Сутність перебуває як синьо-чорна глибина Усього та сяючий кобальт
сутінкового неба, ніщо і не-ніщо, чистий Первісний Потенціал (ye shes kyi rang bzhin), що
спонтанно проявляється як кольори веселки та світло, яке виявляє усі Явища (chos thams cad),
усі Феномени, які ми переживаємо у нашому житті. Кобальт, лазур і ультрамарин неба, перлинно-сірі
тумани хмар, вологе чи сухе дихання повітря, ніжне чи палюче тепло сонця — усе це сплетено у дедалі
складніші візерунки самих елементальних кольорів.

Червоно-помаранчевий-жовтий, біло-зелено-синій, індиго-фіолетовий-лавандовий, рожевий світанок,
небесна блакить, ледь помітна бірюза глибин чистої води — кольори розгортаються як священні
елементи ('byung ba lnga): Простір, Повітря, Вогонь, Вода і Земля, і , як священні напрями: центр,
північ, захід, схід, південь, верх, низ. Від величних кардинальних енергій цього спільного бачення,
яке ми називаємо життям, до найменших деталей — усе народжується з Живого Світла ('od gsal) і насичене
ним, як послання Первісного Наміру (dgongs pa), що оточує нас у природному світі та може бути прочитане
глибоко в наших Серцях.

Конфігурація Рівного Хреста (mnyam pa'i sdom pa) мандали Тіглє Г'ялчен представляє саму основу еманації,
в якій кольори, елементи та напрями природно впорядковані як цілісність, єдність поза розділенням, але в цій динамічній
рівновазі п'ять чітко виражених кольорів іноді виділяються як організаційні фактори для різноманітних якостей.
Вони іноді представляються як допоміжні засоби для уточнення вашого визнання п'яти якостей Внутрішнього
Сяйва (nang gi 'od gsal). У цій групі кольорів вони використовуються як спосіб усвідомлення тенденції
розуму чіплятися за і перешкоджати справжньому переживанню Первісного Серця (rig pa), перешкоджаючи його розквіту у Внутрішнє Сяйво.

У Візіях Сяйва (thod rgal) діапазон кольорів є набагато динамічнішим, і буквально океани якостей виникають
із вашого Серця поза категоріями. Кольори виходять далеко за межі базового списку: Червоний, Жовто-Золотий,
Білий, Зелений і Синій. Але цей список є відправною точкою для розпізнавання не лише пасток того, як ваш
розум може впливати на ваше переживання Первісного Серця (rig pa) та Внутрішнього Сяйва, але й для визнання
породжувальної сили самих кольорів поза класифікаціями та системами. Присутність і якості кольору також можуть
бути пережиті безпосередньо у природному світі. Теплі кольори виступають вперед і залучають, тоді як прохолодні
кольори заспокоюють і створюють відчуття простору, як у синьому небі та відстані. Зелений лікує і є кольором
життєвої сили рослин тощо.

Блакитний

Колір Синій асоціюється з елементом простору (nam mkha'). Сяюча природа синього та простору є експансивною,
величезною та всеохопною, від синього неба до відтінків далеких гір і глибин моря. Синій — це аспект Сяйва,
який є знанням без знання Єдності (rig pa'i ye shes). Якщо ця експансивна, всеохопна якість не розпізнана
та не прийнята розумом, розум домінуватиме над Серцем і залишатиметься заплутаним у невігластві (ma rig pa),
вираженому як звичні обмеження утримання окремої ідентичності.

Зелений

Колір Зелений асоціюється з елементом вітру (rlung). Сяюча природа зеленого та вітру — це рух, свіжість,
швидкість, активність і життя. Зелений хлорофіл буквально підтримує все життя та ріст на Землі. Зелений
— це аспект Сяйва, що проявляє. Якщо розум привласнює цю енергію прояву для себе, він падає в гордість
(nga rgyal), ототожнення з діючим і зусиллям дії, замість бачити, що все спонтанно виникає,
вже здійснене момент за моментом.

Червоний

Колір червоний асоціюється з елементом вогню (me). Сяюча природа червоного та вогню розпалює і оживляє,
від червоних кров'яних клітин у наших тілах до теплого сяйва багаття, і надихає, приносячи творчість і
медитативне блаженство (bde ba chen po). Червоний — це аспект Сяйва, який освітлює та цінує безліч форм
прояву, але не губиться в деталях. Якщо розум чіпляється за цю широту сприйняття, він спотворює цю енергію
в жадібне утримання бажання (dod chags).

Білий

Колір Білий асоціюється з елементом води (chu). Як велике озеро, сяюча природа білого та води є ясною, плинною,
спокійною та відображаючою. Білий — це Відкритість Сяйва ('od gsal gyi stong pa nyid), що ясно відображає все,
що перед ним з'являється, але не порушується відображеннями. Коли розум втручається зі своїми упередженими
поглядами, ясна дзеркальна якість води та білого тьмяніє, затьмарюється і порушується, а розум може затвердити
досвід у гніві та обуренні (zhe sdang).

Жовтий

Колір Жовто-Золотий асоціюється з елементом землі (sa). Сяюча природа жовто-золотого та землі є врівноважуючою;
від золота зерен урожаю та сонячного світла до багатства вершкового масла та яєчних жовтків, вона живить і
примножує позитивні якості, створюючи взаємопов'язану щедрість, у якій усе є рівним. Жовто-золотий — це аспект
Сяйва, який є виразом укоріненості та стабільності Єдності (zung 'jug). Якщо розум чіпляється за цю щедрість
сприйняття, він заплутується в заздрості (phrag dog).

Коли ви перебуваєте у Візіях Сяйва (thod rgal), ви приходите до дедалі глибшого переживання Сяйва кольору
як первісного виразу Наміру Сутності (ngo bo'i dgongs pa). Кольори, побачені у Візіях Сяйва (thod rgal),
є чимось більшим, ніж оптичні феномени, символи чи нашарування. Кольори живі поза наборами п'яти, поза
усіма категоріями, з якістю їхньої живості, що виходить за межі звичайного сприйняття. Через Візії Сяйва
ви наближаєтеся дедалі ближче до Сутності, бачите їх безпосередньо такими, якими вони є, елементальними
силами, справжньою Тканиною Буття (chos nyid), поза концепціями простору та часу.

klong chen 'od gsal snying thig/ thod rgal gyi snang ba bzhi pa'i mngon gong tshad zad/ Чотири візії тогал: Актуальність, Зростання, Розмах, Вичерпання

1. Візія актуальної природи явищ (chos nyid mngon sum)

Це початковий етап, на якому практикуючі починають сприймати
справжню природу реальності через візії ясного світла,
що знаменує початок безпосередньої реалізації.

Опис:

Практикуючі тренуються з особливими опорами: вдень використовують
сонце або вогняний кристал для дгармакаї (dharmakaya); вночі — місяць
або водяний кристал для самбгоґакаї (sambhogakaya); вранці чи
ввечері — масляну лампу для нірманакаї (nirmanakaya).

Споглядаючи ці опори з розслабленим фокусом (наприклад, трохи
осторонь об'єкта залежно від переважних кольорів), практикуючі
уникають напруження очей і починають бачити райдужні візерунки
та "ланцюг ваджри" (vajra chain) усвідомлення — тонкий, схожий
на перли шнур світла.

Візія проявляється як ясність порожньої життєвої сутності (thig le,
круглі світлові візерунки) та тонких життєвих сутностей, що іноді
є чіткими, а іноді затемненими, подібно до обличчя та його відображення в дзеркалі.
Сяйво суґат (sugatas, будд) у серці проявляється у вигляді райдужних
кольорових візерунків, що вказує на нероздільність аспекту (snang ba,
поява) та природи (stong pa nyid, порожнеча).

Мета та ефект:

Цей етап перевершує чіпляння аналітичного розуму, очищуючи фіксацію на явищах як реальних.
Усвідомлення практикуючого, підтримане каналами мудрості (наприклад,
порожній кристалічний канал kati, що з'єднує серце з очима), звільняється
від затемнювальних факторів, дозволяючи внутрішньому оку праджні (prajna,
мудрості) бачити істину.

Ознаки прогресу включають легке виникнення самадгі (samadhi: блаженство,
ясність, відсутність думок) та надзвичайну аналітичну праджню, що дає
змогу оволодіти мудрістю. Звільнення на цьому етапі забезпечує свободу
від переродження в трьох світах (kham gsum), з можливістю звільнення в
природній чистій сфері нірманакаї, якщо практика переривається.

Ключові характеристики:

Залежить від каналів (вузьких і вигнутих), життєвих сутностей (thig le,
що з'єднуються в точках вигину) та вітрів (rlung, рух), які поступово стабілізуються.
Ланцюг ваджри усвідомлення є одночасно причиною і результатом,
але фіксація на ньому як на матеріальному може призвести до затемнення,
що вимагає безстрашної, неконцептуальної практики.

2. Зростання досвіду візії (nyams gong ‘phel)

Цей етап передбачає поглиблення та розширення візій,
де досвід ясного світла практикуючого посилюється,
а спантанні сприйняття розчиняються.

Опис:

Візії світла стають яскравішими, з п'ятьма кольоровими вогнями, що з'являються
горизонтально, вертикально, сферично або у формах, таких як ступи, лотоси,
палаци, списи, вістря стріл чи візерунки кубиків.

Ясність життєвих сутностей (thig le) зростає від розміру бобу до щита,
рухаючись динамічно, як птах у польоті, олень, що біжить, або бджола, що спускається.

Простір (dbyings) і усвідомлення (rig pa) далі відокремлюються від точки
між бровами, зменшуючи залежність від зовнішніх об'єктів і посилюючи
ясність внутрішнього сяйва.

Внутрішні канали стають прозорими, як світло, пристрасті звільняються,
і практик отримує впевненість у неконцептуальній природі явищ.

Мета та ефект:

Спантанні явища зникають, і практик починає актуалізувати мудрість бардо (bardo),
готуючись до звільнення без повернення в самсару.

Десять ознак очищення (наприклад, дим, міражі) можуть з'явитися,
але визнаються як розумова фіксація, а не остаточне звільнення,
оскільки залежать від інтелекту.
Звільнення на цьому етапі може призвести до переродження в природній
чистій сфері нірманакаї або, за більшої впевненості, до прямого звільнення без бардо.

Специфічні ознаки включають "союз чотирьох аспектів мудрості" (коли
простір і усвідомлення відокремлюються на чотири пальці від брів) або
візії кутових форм і групових утворень, прикрашених лотосами,
що вказують на прогрес до якостей самбгоґакаї.

Ключові характеристики:

Практик розвиває знайомство з візіями, що називається "почуттям знайомства"
або "вищою впевненістю", коли всі явища виникають як життєві сутності та перебувають як багатий масив.

Практика залишається неконцептуальною, спираючись на спонтанне виникнення мудрості,
а не на розумовий аналіз, що відрізняє її від нижчих шляхів.

3. Візія повного розмаху усвідомлення (rig pa tshad phebs)

Цей етап представляє повний прояв якостей самбгоґакаї,
де всі явища сприймаються як чисті сфери та форми будд,
а реалізація практикуючого досягає вершини.

Опис:

Благородні якості самбгоґакаї проявляються повністю як явища шляху,
без розрізнення між природою явищ (chos nyid) та її потенціалом (як
обличчя та його відображення в дзеркалі).

Візії включають поодинокі фігури будд (наприклад, Акшобг'я),
що прогресують до повністю прикрашених божеств із супутниками,
оточених ваджрними огорожами та свитами, які походять від
очищення дгармакаї та нірманакаї.

Специфічні ознаки включають вікна світла між частинками тіла,
тонкі промені світла, що формують гачки, склад aḥ (ah), що
позначає бездоганне світлове тіло, та світло, що випромінюється
з пучка волосся або виступу на маківці (схожого на металеві пластини, підняті вітром).

Тіло сприймається як безчастинкові частки, здатні проникати
крізь тверді об'єкти (наприклад, гори) без перешкод, а розум
досягає яснобачення, всезнання та оволодіння безмежною праджнею і самадгі.

Мета та ефект:

Звичайні явища зупиняються, дуалістичний розум руйнується,
усуваючи надію та страх. Практик стає "наче блукаючий ідіот",
сприймаючи всі явища як всепроникну чистоту.

Тіло, канали та вітри очищаються, розриваючи грубий зв'язок
між тілом і розумом, що веде до бездоганного світлового тіла.

Практик отримує здатність бачити незліченні чисті сфери, рухатися
без перешкод і сприймати самбгоґакаю та гнівні божества в коронній
чакрі, що позначає "повний розмах тіла" та "розуму".

Цей етап перевершує очікування інших філософських доктрин,
які шукають відчутних якостей (наприклад, великих і малих знаків),
і вважається великим дивом Великої Досконалості.

Ключові характеристики:

Візії є абсолютно чіткими, без залежності від зовнішніх об'єктів,
а тіло і розум практикуючого повністю інтегруються з ясним світлом мудрості.

Взаємозалежність візій (наприклад, поодинокі божества, що позначають
як зростання досвіду, так і повний розмах) підкреслює нюансований
прогрес, як пояснили майстри, такі як Вімаламітра та Падмасамбгава.

4. Візія вичерпання природи явищ (сhos zad kyi snang ba)

Останній етап, де всі явища, концепції та навіть самі візії
розчиняються в невимовному просторі дгармакаї,
досягаючи повної буддатаковості.

Опис:

Усі попередні візії, тілесне тіло та об'єкти чуттів розчиняються в
природі явищ (chos nyid), подібно до місяця на тридцятий день, що зникає в просторі.

Сяйво усвідомлення (rig pa) повертається у внутрішній простір,
як світло, поглинене кристалом, не залишаючи слідів концепцій,
пристрастей чи явищ (наприклад, сонця, місяця чи руху).

Практик досягає двох типів просвітлення:

* Повністю досконале буддійство: Жодного сліду тілесного тіла не залишається, як у майстрів, таких як Чецун.
* Повністю проявлене буддійство: Ознаки, такі як світло, звук, реліквії,
  землетруси та гнівні каї, проявляються, як у Дрімеда Одзера в Чімпу.

Тіло стає ясним світлом, безперешкодним, як відображення,
і практик отримує контроль над народженням і входженням,
виконуючи цілі шести класів істот.

Мета та ефект:

Цей етап розриває безперервність трьох світів сансари,
звільняючи практикуючого від переродження та досягаючи
каї великого перенесення (phowa chenpo), яка приносить
користь іншим, доки сансара не спорожніє.

Розум, очищений від усіх концепцій, спочиває в неконцептуальному,
невимовному просторі істини, без будд, живих істот чи розрізнень.

Просвітницька діяльність практикуючого проявляється як будди
самбгоґакаї для бодгісаттв десятого рівня, вища нірманакая
для шраваків і пратьєкабудд, і різноманітні форми (ремісники,
перевтілення) для звичайних істот.

Навіть упадеши гуру та філософія практикуючого розчиняються,
залишаючи лише неутримуючий Серединний Шлях Великої Досконалості.

Ключові характеристики:

Може відбуватися поступово через прогресію чотирьох візій або миттєво
для практиків із вищою інтелектуальною здатністю, обходячи проміжні етапи.

Остаточне вичерпання — це не припинення існування, а реалізація первісної
чистоти усвідомлення, вільної від усіх крайнощів і ускладнень.

Унікально для тогал, цей етап уможливлює чудодійні дії та звільнення
істот (наприклад, 3000 людських чи бардо істот) без фізичних залишків,
як продемонстрував Падмасамбгава.

Ключові аспекти чотирьох ясностей

Неконцептуальна природа: Ясності виникають спонтанно з вродженої мудрості
практикуючого, а не через зусилля чи інтелектуальні конструкції,
що відрізняє тогал від інших шляхів.

Прогресивне очищення: Кожен етап очищає специфічні аспекти
спантанності (наприклад, фіксацію, пристрасті, грубі зв'язки між тілом і розумом),
завершуючись повним розчиненням у дгармакаї.

Роль ключових точок: Три ключові точки (пози, споглядання, вітри/усвідомлення)
та канал мудрості (порожній кристалічний kati) є вирішальними для проявлення та стабілізації візій.

Взаємозалежність: Візії є взаємозалежними, з перехресними ознаками (наприклад,
поодинокі божества в обох етапах зростання досвіду та повного розмаху),
що вимагає точного розуміння для уникнення неправильного тлумачення.

Швидкий шлях: На відміну від поступових п'яти шляхів праджняпараміти,
чотири ясності тогал пропонують швидкий шлях до буддійства,
часто в межах одного життя або бардо, завдяки безпосередній реалізації ясного світла.

Практичний контекст

Передумови: Тогал вимагає попередніх практик (наприклад, trekcho,
практики розрізнення), щоб стабілізувати розум і очистити карму,
забезпечуючи готовність до цих передових візій.

Посвята: Надання енергії усвідомлення (rig pa'i rtsal dbang) від
реалізованого ваджрного вчителя є необхідним, спрямовуючи учнів
у мандалу усвідомлення та чистих сфер.

Ознаки та поведінка: Практикуючі повинні розпізнавати ознаки (наприклад,
ланцюг ваджри, групові утворення) і уникати відхилень (наприклад, фіксації
на візіях як реальних чи помилкового сприйняття впливів мар), підтримуючи
безстрашну, неконцептуальну поведінку.

Індивідуальні відмінності: Прогресія та прояв візій варіюються залежно
від індивідуальних здібностей, із вищими практиками, що досягають
миттєвого вичерпання, та іншими, що прогресують поступово.

Висновок

Чотири ясності тогал представляють трансформаційну подорож від початкових проблисків природи явищ
до повного розчинення всіх явищ у дгармакаї. Вони інтегрують тіло, мову та розум із трьома каями,
дозволяючи практикуючим реалізувати свою первісну мудрість і досягти буддійства,
або без фізичних залишків, або з проявленими ознаками. Цей шлях, унікальний для Остаточного Довершення,
славиться своєю безпосередністю та глибокою здатністю звільняти як практикуючого, так і інших,
виконуючи кінцеву мету просвітлення.

From the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse of the Great Perfection, A Practice Manual for the Stages of the Path of the Original Protector entitled Yeshe Lama

HOMAGE AND STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT

| [2] Homage to the Conqueror, the Teacher of Unchanging Light, (10)
| Whose intrinsic nature [3] is the inconceivable nature of phenom ena like the basic space of the sky,
| The original state where neither existence nor quiescence ever falls to any direction,
| Where every aspect is endowed with the supreme nature,
| The indivisibility of space and wisdom. [4]
| You are the epitome of the aspect of appearance:
| Glorious Original Protector, 11 with consort and retinue,
| May you remain ever victorious within the lotus lake of my mind.

| The intrinsic nature is primordially unchanging, the object to be purified a temporary stain.
| Through the teacher who embodies the three kayas, a rain of dharma [5] descends to completely cleanse [all stains]
| In accordance with the capabilities, faculties, and intentions of
| those who approach gradually and simultaneously.

| This is the sole chariot-superb spiritual path-of the Great
| Perfection which brings about simultaneous liberation. [6]
| Here, for a million ages, the most excellent merit has been amassed and fully dedicated by those who are life trees [of this tradition].
| By their glory, they appeared in the world as the incarnate scholars and translators of the past
| Who brought and upheld the undiminished victory banner of explanations in the Land of Snow Mountains. (13)
| O Lord of Speech, (14) life tree of the doctrine, may your feet adorn the crown of my head.

| The meaning of the ocean of tantra is so deeply profound and supremely vast,
| Except for the Omniscient One, with his natural wisdom capacity

| The presumptuous cannot hope to comprehend this.
| Nevertheless, Drimed Odzer has lifted the veil of obscurity to expose the meaning of all that is.
| Here, I will dearly synthesize whatever he revealed to fuUill the supplications of the fortunate disciples. [7]

Well then, even though the wisdom intent of the fully enlightened Buddha Kuntuzangpo never wavers from the space of phenomena,
through his wisdom mind he gives transmission to the five resultant buddhas not
other than himself. Having taught the profound and vast fully endowed
Secret Mantra" vajra vehicle and illuminating the three classes of tantra,
transmission, and upadcsha, the minds ofbeings-disciples to be tamed-
are naturally led to freedom. Here, without taking the generation and
completion stages into consideration, the nature of mindb is revealed as
the intrinsic nature of the primordial buddha, the fundamental nature•
of original purity.(4) [8] The view of lhun drub togal explains that everything is awakened as wisdom,
the nature of one's own appearances. These introductions arc explicated without rhetoric or analytical investigation;
rather, they serve as a direct introduction for encountering the nature of the mind.

As the path upon which the buddhas of the past embarked, that which
all future buddhas wUI achieve, and the sole pathway of all buddhas of
the present, this perfccdy sublime peak of all vehicles is untouched by the
intdJccrual tenets of the other cight. 17 Here, I intend to so dearly reveal the
natural great expanse of the wisdom intent of genuine truth, the original
buddha Kuntuzangpo, that it will seem to be spread across the palm of the
hand. [9] May the hosts of dharma-keeper c;lakinis grant pcnnission! 11
Herein lies the threefold tradition of giving oral instructions: the tra-
dition of giving instruction, of direcdy encountering, and of complete
entrustment to the traveler who is crossing over the mountain pass." [Ytsht
Lama] belongs to the first and, as the tradition of upadesha, it includes the
other two. This teaching will be given by means of three stages: for those
ofkeen faculty. who possess the force of the cause10 in order to arrive in the
absolute space of the original ground' in this lifetime; those of middling
faculty. who will be enlightened in the bardo; and those oflesser faculty,
who will take their next breath in a natural nirmir)akaya pure realm. [10]

FOR THOSE OF KEEN FACULTY

First, for the overview, there are two parts: the preliminaries and the actual teaching.

PRELIMINARY PRACTICES

For the preliminaries there are three ways to train: in order to discove~ 1
the three kayas, the way of training in the practice of the four elements;
in order to discover awareness, discerning sarpsara and enlightenmenr-u
with the three doors; and in order to discover the mind, training the body,
speech, and mind.

Training in the Practice of the Four Elements

First, of the six million four hundred thousand verses on the natural Great
Perfection,• in the extraordinary root tantra Rn~uberation ofSountf 13 it states:

| The stages of training in the three kayas emphasize the qualities
| of the elements. Diligently training in the sound of earth, water,
| fire, and wind will bring cenain accomplishment.

Thus, [11] although this quote expresses the value of practicing with the
four sounds [of the elements], since this is seldom practiced anymore, it is
acceptable to omit this.

Discerning Samsara and Enlightenment

Second, for discerning samsara and enlightenment, among both the outer
and inner, first the outer discernment is according to the Tantra of the Single Child of the Doctrine:

| Initially, begin with conduct in order to reverse the fixation of
| taking things as real through body, speech, and mind.

Thus, the way of acting is as the root tantra (24) states:

| Use the body to go, stay, twist, and perform various postures;
| stretching the extremities out and drawing them back in, perform
| many types of activity. Engage mindfully in the conduct
| and forms of the beings of the six classes and [12] physically
| enact whatever comes to mind.

As stated, this will reverse the activities of the three doors that are gen-
erated through karmic habits, eventually bringing them to a halt. To avoid
the fault of the seventh downfall-namely, exposing secret conduct-one
must retreat to an isolated place where it is certain no passersby can observe
you. So that the local guardians of the environment will not become jealous
or disturbed while you engage in impulsive conduct, offer them a torma,
entreating them to enact miraculous activities. Now, in order to benefit all
sentient beings, think that you must engage in the practice of discerning
sarpsara and enlightenment with body, speech, and mind and that hereaf-
ter rebirth in existence will not occur! Give rise to this intention. [13] Then
strip down to the bare flesh and take upon yourself the extreme heat and
cold of the hells; the hunger and thirst of the deprived spirits;b the mis-
treatment and abuse of animals; the birth, old age, sickness, and death of
humans; the warfare of titans; and the exhaustion of merit and inevitable
plunge of the gods,< Make this a personal experience complete with the
physical drama of running here and there, jumping, twisting, and flinging
the extremities back and forth. In short, put to action whatever comes to
mind by following one's impulses without restriction or focus.

Likewise, the practice for discerning speech is as stated in the Reberberation of Sound:


| So as to eliminate the necessity to respond to whatever is said,
| express the various pleasing and displeasing utterances of dcvas,
| nagas, yalqhas, gandharvas, kumbhandas, and rahulas.• [14)
| In short, bring to mind and give expression to the dialects of the six classes.

Thus, as taught, make idle, senseless chatter and repeat the
sounds of various languages without the least concern for what should be accepted or rejected.
The activity of the mind is as stated in the Sole Heir ofthe Buddha:

| Cultivate a variety of mental states such as joy, displeasure, bliss,
| sorrow, permanence, impermanence, contemplation of the
| view, meditation, conduct, spirituality, worldliness, attachment,
| hatred, delusion, virtue, nonvirtuc, and so forth.

Thus, just as taught, forcefully invoking the proliferation of virtuous and
nonvirtuous recollections concerning the three times, [ 1 s] the three doors
will become quite weary, at which time one should rest and observe the
nature of the ensuing state that has severed prideful complacency. Like-
wise, it states in the Last Testammt:•

| One should also engage in the activity of the Three Jewels.

Thus, that means one should assume the vajra posture, with hands in the
earth-touching mudra. hnagine wearing the robes of ordination and that
light rays radiate from the hair coil between one's eyebrows. Engage in
peaceful conduct such as gazing out about the length of a yoke and so
forth. The activity of speech is to recite suuas such as the Heart Sutra
and others. Mentally analyze words as well as the tenets of the Prasailgika•
Madhyamaka philosophy.

Likewise assume wrathful postures [16] with the play of the nine char-
acteristics of dance. The activity of speech is to shout the sounds of rulu
rulu, hung hun~ phtt phtt, and so forth. Train in the ability of the body
and speech to adopt a variety of mannerisms. As the tantra states:

| Discuss various sounds of dharma such as mantras, prayers, phi-
| losophy, existence, nonexistence, and phenomena.

In this way, the discernment practices individually correspond to body,
speech, and mind. There arc also practices for alternating the preliminaries
ofbody, speech, and mind. Nevertheless, any characteristic of sa~psara and
enlightenment naturally arises as the manifestation of the three doors and
three kayas. To engage in these practices simultaneously is not only practi-
cal but extremely valuable. [17] Diligendy practicing this discernment for
half a month, eleven, or seven days in the short term will bring about the
natural reversal of fixation [that occurs] through the three doors and the
continuity of cyclic interdependence will cease. Ultimately, the body will
mature as dear light,b the speech will be purified as the chakra of syllables,
and the mind will be set free in awareness. It is taught that the benefits arc
boundless, and in bricfit states in the Rtalization ofEmpowtrmmt:'

| Whoever engages in the discernment [practices] will never
| return to the three realms!

So, it is.

Second, the inner divisions of practice [18] are according to the wisdom
intent of the Cltar Expaml tantra, which states:
At the crown, throat, heart, navel, secret place, and soles of the
feet abide the syllables ah, su, nri, tri, prt, and du.

Thus, once this habitual body exists, the seed syllables that bring about
the six classes of rebirth abide continually, along with the previow kar-
mic impressions. Since this becomes the circumstance perpetuating that
which follows, even at the moment of death, the subde wind-mind• will
gather wherever the syllables of the channels" abide and the [conscious-
ness] will be transferred to that state of rebirth. Therefore, during the pres-
ent time of the path, this extraordinary tradition of purification which
involves many easily applied methods is a special feature of this unsur-
passed vehicle. [19]

The manner of purification is as stated in the Last Testament:

| Because this body has arisen from the cause of ignorance: the
| seed syllables of the six classes endure. Because awareness is actually
| the three kayas, the three kayas arise as the three syllables. (25)
| Training with the syllables is the discernment.

Thus, as taught, the basis for the purification is the syllable of the gods, a
white ah located at the crown; the syllable of the titans, a yellow-greensu at
the throat; the syllable of humans, a pale blue nri at the heart; the syllable
of animals, a red-black tri at the navel; the syllable of the deprived spirits,
a dust-colored pre at the secret place; and the syllable of the hells, a smoke-
colored du at the soles of the feet. That which purifies is wisdom awareness
indivisible with all the buddhas [1.0] which is the intrinsic nature of the
three vajras appearing as a white om in the crown, a red ah in the throat,
and a blue hung in the heart. Clearly imagine these three syllables ablaze
with splendor. With the repetition of the sound of the three syllables, light
rays emerge to purify the seed syllables of the six classes including all hab-
its. Consider that everything is purified and nothing remains. Recite one
hundred tho wand repetitions ofom, ah, and hung for each of the seed syl-
lables of the six classes, along with additional accumulations to compen-
sate for shortcomings, bringing the total to seven hundred thousand. This
will bring about the signs of the purification of negativity, and ordinary
fixated attachment will be purified ofits own accord. In the Ckar Expans~
it states: [21]

| Whoever trains in the inner discernment
| Will eliminate the seeds that cause the confusion of samsara.

Thus, it is.

Training the Body, Speech, and Mind

Third, in order to discover the mind there are the three preliminaries to
train the three doors.

Training the Body

First is training the body. In the Reverberation ofSound it states:

| By the preliminary practice of the body,
| The causes of the individual functions cease.
| To assume the vajra posture and train with the body
| Benefits the mind.

There are two assertions explaining how to either stand or sit in the vajra
posture. First, join the heels of both feet, extend the knees outward, and
straighten the back. Join both palms and, while extending the elbows out,
[22] bring the hands over the crown withouttouching it. Tucking the chin
down to meet the Adam's apple, imagine the body to be a blazing blue vajra
with three prongs. When tiring of this, adopt the second unchanging vajra
posture. Holding the body so that it resembles a vajra, keep the torso erect,
arresting the all-pervasive winds. Joining the soles of the feet eliminates the
male, female, and neutral winds so that one can naturally abide within the
clear light of wisdom. Placing the two heels forcefully against the secret
place eliminates the basis of desire. By pressing the palms together above
the crown of the head, one trains in the key point of the body. Thus, these
are the assertions of the Omniscient One.

The way of implementing pure recollection is to consider that the three
upper points indicate the nature, intrinsic nature, and compassion, The
three lower points indicate the three kiyas, [23] and the central hub that
connects them indicates that the single nature of original purity and spon-
taneous prcscnccal6 is taken as the path.
There arc three reasons for this [stage of the practice]. In general, physi-
cal exhaustion purifies physical obstructions; and, in particular, imagining
that the body is a vajra ablaze with fire pacifies demonic and obstruct-
ing forces. Ultimately, attachment to the body will be reversed and the
vajrakaya established. At that time, the meaning of the interdependent
connection being aligned with the body so that realization arises in the
mind is that-by the circumstance of such exhausting activities-one sev-
ers the unceasing flow of concepts,& leaving naked awareness free of sup-
port. [24] This makes it easy to strike the vital point of encountering the
nature of mind.

Training the Speech

Second is training the speech. In the Reverbuation of Sound it states:
Since speech abides as the syllable hung-through sealing, training,
seeking flexibility, and entering the path-training the ...

Sealing

First, of these four categories, sealing is twofold: the outer scaling of
appearances and the inner sealing of the aggregates.

In an isolated place, assume the vajra posture and recite hung hung hung
hung. By reciting with a sustained melody, imagine that the entire universe
and inhabitants rum into hung. Just barely bringing your teeth and lips
together, without distraction mingle appearances, winds, and cognition as
one. [25] All appearances arise only as hung; and, if [appearances] become
insubstantial and uncertain, this indicates the sealing. The purpose for this
is that objective appearances will be naturally liberated.

Second, the inner scaling of the aggrcgatcs17 is that once again, by recit-
ing hung, all the outer bungs that emerged from one another now enter
one's body through the orifices of the sense organs. As they consume the
body, all internal organs-including flesh and blood-become purified
and nonconccptual. Maintaining the winds is a key point while considering
that the entire body becomes filled with bungs. [2.6] The purpose for this
is that the elements of the body will be purified and, without contamina-
tion, the corporeal form will be liberated.

Training

Second, training has two. First, by training with external appearances
through the circumstance of forcefully reciting hung hung, sharp, swifi:
blue-black bungs begin to shoot like bolts oflighming [which are] the size
of the objects that will be penetrated. Consider that all mountains and
houses which ordinarily appear solid are riddled with holes. The purpose
of this is to recognize that appearances lack true existence.

Second, training with the inner aggregates one imagines a blue-black
hung [2.7] the size of a hand span penetrating one's entire body, piercing
holes so that [it] is reduced to particles. Recite hung with tremendous
force. The sign of success is that the body muscles begin to quiver and,
similar to a reflection in a mirror, the experience of there being no true,
inherent existence arises. This pacifies illness and demonic-force posses-
sion of the inner aggregates and serves the purpose of liberating the body
in clear light.

Seeking Flexibility

Third, in seeking flexibility, one places a stick or other support in front
of onesel£ While reciting hung hung, imagine that an unceasing chain
of bungs rises up from the base of the support, gradually wrapping itself
around the stick all the way to the tip where the lead hung stands erect.
[2.8] Focusing one's attention there, slowly and melodiously chant hung.
When becoming tired, once again concentrate upon each hung dissolving
back into the other and finally gathering into one's heart. Relax. By repeat-
edly practicing in this way, all outer and inner concepts become the path
and the qualities of a flexible, exuberant mind are evidenced along with the
ability to control and transform any visualization.

Entering the Path

Fourth, for the practice: of entering the path, one visualizes oneself to be a
blue hung one cubit in size:, weaving along like a worm to many different
destinations. Starting with visible objects such as mountains and valleys,
imagine continuing to move slowly through many familiar places, [29]
like a tourist reaching the destination of a journey, while slowly reciting
hung in a manner that matches one's movement. The:: purpose is that,
through this cleansing of objective habits, the body and speech can be
rendered functional. Again, by reciting hung hung, one suddenly arrives
in the eastern pure realm of Manifest joy• or any realm of one's choicc::/1
like an arrow shot by an archer. This establishes an auspicious connection
for rebirth in the pure lands. In all cases wherever the mind is directed,
uniting and maintaining the wind, mind, and hung with single-pointed
concentration surpasses any other method for arresting concepts. [30]
Through this, the speech is purified of obstructions and liberated as the
sambhogakaya.

Training the Mind

Third, training the mind is as stated in the Revubuation ofSound:

| First, if the origin of the mind, the place of abiding, and the final
| destination are carefully analyzed, training in this way allows
| one to know the fundamental nature of the mind.

Thus, for training the mind, there is the actual mind training and the manner of resting in tranquility.

Actual Mind Training

First, there are three, beginning with an examination of the origin of the
mind and the origin of the apprchender.

If there is mind, from what direction does it originate? Does it stem
from the outer universe and its inhabitants, from existing outer and inner
appearances, or from the nonexistent state of emptiness and the like? [31]
If one claims that [the mind] originates from the standpoint of existence,
this falls to the direction of the philosophical tenets of the shravakas. One
should understand [the mind] by eradicating all fixation on the true exis-
tence of appearances into particles. Through such analysis, the origin of
the mind cannot be discovered, including reduction to a partless parti-
cle. Although one may recognize that [the mind] is naturally nonexis-
tent like a dream, if the arising of the unceasing, indifferent apprehending
mind-for example, the mind and mental activity-is not severed from
the root, then this is like the view of the Middle Way Mind Only SchooF'
of nonaffirming and affirming negation. Having fallen to rhe direction of
harboring expectations about rhe fundamental nature, one should [p.]
turn within to observe rhe mind of rhe apprehender! While doing so, if
one asserrs mat rhe mind mat momentarily remains in narural radiance•
or arises as various concepts is genuine, rhis is to base one's confidence on
rhe unsupported platirude of rhe mind.

Still lacking a direct realization of awareness, ifone claims mat rhe mind
originates from rhe perspective of emptiness, men rhe originator must cer-
tainly have shape, color, size, and characteristics. The intrinsic nature of
rhis must be analyzed. Through such analysis, me dualistic appearance of
a searcher and the sought become free from support or object. If left in a
state mat is nonconceptual and free of all words, expressions, rhoughrs,
[33] and theories, rhe meaning of rhe unborn dharmakaya- "baseless
from rhe root" - will be able to be internalized. In me Middle Way Con-
sequence' [siitra] it states:

| Since I have no definitive position, I am completely faultless

Thus, rhis is to arrive there. Even the way of arriving is not like rhe claims
of present-day philosophers who boast rhey hold rhis view [of rhe heart
essenced]. Unlike those intellectual exercises and analyses, through rhis
natural Great Perfection, one will arrive by beholding rhe nature of phe-
nomena.• This is what I have to say! (30)

Second, investigating rhe place of abiding and rhe abider is as follows.
If rhis present mind arises externally, it is rhe outer object. Ifit arises inter-
nally, [34] it is rhe inner body. By analyzing rhe place where it abides-
whether outside, inside, upper, lower, head, feet, or wherever-if the place
of abiding can be seen, rhen rhat shape, color, function, and so form must
also be investigated so mat rhis false, hollow cavern can collapse. When
one fails to observe anything externally or internally and directly analyzes
rhat which abides, that is merely rhe narural radiance of rhe consciousness
of rhe basis of allr arising as truly existing. This approaches rhe view of rhe
False Image Mind Only School.• Here, the mind has no cause or character-
istics, being more or less like writing on water which-even while occur-
ring-vanishes without a trace. Just like when a ship has sunk and the
[captain] frantically attempts to seize anything but there is only water-
at the moment of searching for the place of abiding, the searcher naturally
vanishes, [35] thereby establishing the abider to be free from identification.
This internalizes the meaning of the unceasing sambhogakaya.

At the present moment, through the continuity of the feelings of the
three doors, wherever the experience of contact occurs, such as being poked
by a thorn, it seems as though existing right there. With the compounded
aggregates as the cause and the sudden onset of concepts as the contrib-
uting circumstance, the fixating mind attaches to the object of grasping,
resulting in the self as the possessor. When dualistic grasping is eliminated,
then at the time of arriving at the ground of the exhaustion of the nature of
phenomena, (31) the saying even if surrounded by a hundred messengers of
Avichi [hell] [36] there would be no anxiety or fear is then understood.

Third, investigating the traveler and the destination is as follows. While
investigating the destination of the traveler-whether it be the outer and
inner universe and inhabitants, appearances, emptiness, existence,
nonexistence, or something else, whatever the direction may be-by not
discovering any place to go, grasping with hope and fear for a result is then
reversed. If something is discovered, it is then necessary to determine the
details about the traveler such as any physical characteristics. If. during
this investigation, it is determined that there is nothing [that exists], one
will have the assurance of knowing that materializing phenomenabn cannot
result in enlightenment.

Since there is no destination, one will surely conclude that objective
appearances are fabricated by the mind. Since there is no traveler, one
will gain confidence in knowing that the subject is naturally nonexis-
tent. [37] It is then that empty awareness-devoid of coming or going-
is ascertained as the nirmat}akaya. This is the extraordinarily swifi path
because even the pith instructions on the collapse of the constructs of
the mind are included within the uncommon [instructions] on the ori-
gin, abiding, and destination. Through training in these preliminary
practices corresponding to the mind, on the mundane level negativ-
itics and obstructions arc purified and obstacles arc pacified. Fixation
is reversed: and, in particular, by means of distinguishing satpsara and
enlightenment, the characteristics of the mind arc liberated in the wis-
dom of empty awareness. Ultimately, one will become indivisible with
all the buddhas and arrive at the state of the original ground of vajra
mind. [38]

Manner of Resting in Tranquility

For the second, there arc two: resting in tranquility" and rcstoration.bn
First, in the Rtverberation ofSound it states:

| At this time, the key point for the practitioner
| Is to rest body, speech, and mind in tranquility.

Thus, through the exceptional activity of the preliminaries, some dis-
turbances of the physical constitution and clements arc produced. In
order to establish this as the innate nature of tranquility, the key point for
the body involves transcending good, bad, accepting, and rejecting. The
body is positioned as though it were a corpse in a charnel ground, and
the speech should remain in the nature free from expression. While train-
ing, one's breath should be slow and even. Like a cloudless sky, the mind
should remain free from the distraction of recollections and concepts. [39]
Practice this yoga, free of action or activity, and remain in tranquility for
twenty-one, seven, or three successive days. The reason for doing this is elu-
cidated in the Ckar Expanst tantra:

| Whoever is able to remain in tranquility will pacify the circum-
| stances that lead to imbalances of the elements and naturally
| liberate grasping.

Second, the practice of restoration is as it states in the Last Ttstammt:

| Restore through the gaze of the shravakas, bodhisattvas, and
| herukas. Gaining restoration through the three doors will
| encourage diligence in practice.

Thus, first, with the gaze of the shravakas, [40] assuming the seven-
point posture ofVairochana, remain without inhibiting the emergence of
perceivable concepts. Second, with the gaze of the bodhisattvas, allow the
eyes to gaze without any particular focus no farther than the length of a
yoke. Third, with the gaze of the herukas, part the legs in the advancing
posture [and], with aggressively darting eyes, stare into space. Shout aloud
ha ha, the fierce and haunting laugh of the hcrukas, and sing hi hi, the
female heruka song that is heard from afar. Train in this fearless conduct
that collapses the false, hollow cavern of appearances. The purpose of this
is as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| Through the peaceful gaze of the shravakas, the body, speech,
| and mind become tranquil. Through the gaze of the bodhisat-
| tvas, [ 41] tranquility becomes the nature of bliss. Through the
| gaze of the herukas, the three qualities of tranquility will also occur.

Thus, it is.

In the older texts, there arc some distinctions concerning the seven-
point posture in that the gaze of the eyes is said to be focused on the tip
of the nose, the gaze of the bodhisattvas is not necessarily peaceful, and so
forth. These presumptions are not well thought out.

ACTUAL TEACHING

Second, there are two ways of giving the actual teaching.

First, in order to sow the seeds of the four kayas as well as to render the
practitioner suitable for meditating on the swift path, by [the practitioner's]
entering the great mandala of empowerment, all activities that bring
maturity are naturally acquired at this time. [42] To give all the teachings
and then confer empowerment is not only illogical but an unpleasant spec-
tacle for those who understand the meaning of the tantras.

For the second, from the perspective of definition, this-the unsurpassed
vehicle ofthe vajra essence-takes the result as the path.That is why it is the
actual basis of all paths leading to buddhahood.The nature ofthe result also
encounters awareness. First of all, if we were to consider the ground with-
out its actual nature, it would be like seeing a temple but not the three sup-
ports in it. To think of profound and luminous empty appearances as mere
terms mat relate tO one anomer is simply insufficient for establishing trust
in the view and meditation. [43] Moreover, considering the actual nature
wimout me ground is similar to seeing the mrcc supports [in the temple]
but failing to establish their characteristics. Although having intellectually
understood mis through the four dogmas and by means of the eight limitations
free from elaboration,)! because mere is no inner experience, it is
unstable. To consider that this [rigpa] is not the ground or the actual nature
is like not seeing eimcr the temple or the statue of Shakyamuni within. (35)
The teachings state, '"Phenomena arc without inherent existence." Taking
that as a pam of mere mental speculation fails to directly encounter the
nature mat is wimout inherent existence. That is why [the Great Perfec-
tion] is not like a philosophy that ensures death will be ordinary.

Here the view of the heart essence of the natural Great Perfection
includes bom the actual nature and the ground. [44] Just like precisely
establishing me way the support and supported abide, one is able to
encounter a direct realization of natural liberation wimout depending on
imagining there is a view or meditation.

For the second, there are two divisions beginningwim the oral instruc-
tions on trekcho for those with keen faculties who, without meditation,
achieve liberation with total confidence. (36) By meditating on togal, those
with great diligence will liberate the phenomena of the path of the three
kayas and become enlightened without leaving a body behind. (37)

Oral Instructions on Trekcho

For the first, due to the distinction of faculties, there arc two ways of
encountering the nature.

Common Method

First, for the common, if a disciple of the heart essence possesses faith but
their mind is still obscured, [45] it is as stated in the Adorned by Direct
Introduction:

| Eh ma ho! Introducing appearances to be the mind, the mind
| gains proficiency. In tum, introducing the nature of mind to be
| empty. emptiness is sealed with bliss. Introducing emptiness to
| be awareness, the nature of awareness itself becomes indivisible
| with space-the dharmakaya nature just as it is.

Thus, similarly introducing appearances as fabrications of mind, holding
to true existence is reversed. In consequence, when the fabricating mind is
realized as empty, attachment to external appearances is purified. (31) Intro-
ducing emptiness to be awareness prevents one from the nihilistic inter-
pretation of the nature of phenomena.

This way of teaching emphasizes these key points, but having understood
that, this does not even approach the direction of the wisdom intent [46]
of the heart essence as it is stated in the Naturally Arising (Awarentss):

| The mind yoga of appearances means that everything originates
| from my mind. If this mind is realized, what else is there
| to do? I have never said that those who keep saying this will be liberated.

So, it is taught.

In other texts, it is said that ultimately there is no mind. But continuing
to believe that the relative exists, there are those who will conceptualize the
view and meditation and practice that as the path. Likewise, even with the
dharma term ·unity; there is still a significant difference between the con-
struction of unity by bringing two things together and this dharma of the
Great Perfection-the originally pure, great, even perfection of awareness
and emptiness-where nothing is united. [47] It is for this reason that this
is a great, impartial distinction! Therefore, the Omniscient One said:

| It must be known that approaches which introduce appear-
| ances as mind and the mind's nature as empty arc not the wis-
| dom intent of upadeshas' heart-essence approach. While such
| approaches may be found in some upadeshas, it is in order to
| lead the lower to the higher but definitely not the definitive
| meaning.

As it is explained, the direct valid cognition that appearances are not the
mind is [proved] during [dreamless] sleep, unconsciousness, the two states
of union, and [the state of] perpetual lack of awareness. As it explains in
Discerning the Middle and Limits, [48] during these five occasions of
being mindless, appearances have never gone anywhere. This is illustrated
by the experience of finding a jewel in a previous night's dream and the
experience of sexual pleasure; when one awakens from the joy and fixa-
tion upon its true existence, it is discovered that nothing remains. Because
of that, one can gain certainty that various appearances and recollections
arise from temporary circumstances.

These days, since the doctrine of the Great Perfection is declining, there
are many who trust only this method of direcdy encountering. Here, in
order to reveal the direct path, it is as stated in the NaturaUy Arising:

| When the lion roars with his own voice, all other creatures of the
| wild pass out from fear. When the Great Perfection uses its own
| language, all those of the lower vehicles lose consciousness.

Thus, as taught, [49] those who lack the fortune to consider cause and
result on the level of the doctrine of definitive truth and those who expect
results in the Great Perfection through mental analysis will verbally abuse
this system. However, the Omniscient One has said:

| It should be dearly understood that the assertion that appearances
| are the mind is the great darkness of perverted understanding.

Thus, based on this advice, the reason for giving such an elaborate
explanation is in order to polish this path.

Uncommon Explanation

Second, the uncommon explanation for completely and direcdy introduc-
ing [the mind's nature] resembles the restoration of vision to a blind per-
son. Asking the disciples to assume the unchanging vajra posture, with
vajra and bell [the vajra master] melodiously chants the lineage supplica-
tion which transforms the ordinary mind. [so] After that, [the vajra mas-
ter says]:

Kye! Do not contrive or elaborate the awareness of this very
moment. Allow it to be just as it is. This is not established as
existing, not existing, or having a direction. It docs not dis-
cern between emptiness and appearances and docs not have
the characteristics of nihilism and ctcrnalism. Within this state
where nothing exists, it is unnecessary to exert effort through
view or meditation. The great primordial liberation is not like
being released from bondage. It is natural radiance uncontrivcd
by the intellect, wisdom unsullied by concepts. The nature of
phenomena, not tainted by the view and meditation, is even-
ness without placement and postevenness without premedita-
tion. It is clarity without characteristics and vastness not lost to
uniformity. [s•] Although all sentient beings have never been
separate from their own indwelling wisdom even for an instant,
by failing to recognize this, it becomes like a natural Aow of
water solidifying into icc. With the inner grasping mind as the
root cause and outer objective clinging as the conuibuting cir-
cumstance, beings wander in s:upsara indefinitely. Now, with
the guru's oral insuuctions, at the moment of encountering
awareness-without any mental constructions-rest in the way
things truly arc, without wavering from or meditating on any-
thing. This fully reveals the core wisdom intent of the primor-
dial Buddha Kuntuzangpo. [52]

In the Sixfold Expanse it states:

| The mind's nature, neither eternal nor nonexistent, is phenom-
| ena free of good or bad. This is called the wisdom intent free of
| accepting or rejecting: I, Kuntuzangpo, have revealed it. This
| nature of mind, devoid of accepting and rejecting, perceives
| things as naturally liberated without direction. It is called the
| great all-encompassing wisdom intent: I, Kuntuzangpo, have
| revealed it. This nature of mind, devoid oflethargy or elation,
| is the wisdom intent of great evenness. It is called the wisdom
| intent of the natural condition of the six groups: 39 I, Kuntu-
| zangpo, have revealed it. This nature of mind, which is fearless,
| perceives things free of expectation or disappointment. [s3] It
| is called the wisdom intent that dwells in the confidence ofpri-
| mordial evenness: I, Kuntuzangpo, have revealed it.
| perceives things free of expectation or disappointment. [s3] It
| is called the wisdom intent that dwells in the confidence ofpri-
| mordial evenness: I, Kuntuzangpo, have revealed it.

Thus, and it also states in the Heap of Precious Jewels:

| This nature of phenomena without base, left as it is without
| being sought, is the greatest of marvels. This awareness, going
| and coming without ever meeting, is the greatest of marvels.
| This great wisdom that primordially abides, devoid of antidotes,
| is the greatest of marvels.

Thus, and in Tht All-Crtating Monarch it states:

| Even all the buddhas of the past did not search anywhere
| other than their own mind. Aside from what they already
| were, they made no adjustments. They never practiced concep-
| tual samadhi,' and they accomplished the nature of their own
| minds through that which is nonconeeptual. [S4] Similarly,
| even the buddhas of the present and those to come in the future
| | will achieve accomplishment only through the nonconceptual
| nature of evenness.

Thus, according to the tradition of this vehicle, the nature of the mind
is-from the very beginning-great natural liberation. Recognizing
that is called ·awareness." By maintaining this continuity, the state of
buddhahood will be direcdy realized, which is why this path is more expe-
ditious than any other. In this way, [practitioners] will gain inspiration.

In addition, [the instructions] on clarifying doubt and subduing hin-
drances are as follows. While maintaining the continuity of the great,
indwelling fundamental nature, if one thinks that the nature of this aware-
ness is empty. the one ascribing emptiness to this is the intellect, which
has a focal point. [ss] The way that meditative concentrationd with a focal
point does not produce buddhahood is as stated in the Ptifected Skill of
the Lion• tantra:

| The meaning of the nature of phenomena cannot be seen
| through meditation with concentration. The samadhi of one's
| own appearancesb eludes the direction of concentration. Free
| from elaboration, the nature of phenomena is equal to the
| limits of space. All mental considerations arc devoid of con-
| ceptual fixation with objects. The dharmakaya buddha free
| from the four extremes, 40 such as existing or not, is one's own
| awareness.

Thus, this explains the method for purifying the encumbrance of holding
to emptiness as true into the nature of great freedom from limitation.

In addition, even though there may be the confidence of thinking "this
is how it is" to rest in the nature that is beyond the limitation of existence
or nonexistence and [s6] to be bound to such a sense of assurance is a dense
veil obstructing one's own ground ofbeing. As the Great Garut!a' states:
Any attempt to search for or discover a state free from dogma
and limitation is like a blind bird searching for the end of space.
Nothing can be found. The meaning that nothing can be found
cannot be adjusted by anyone. It is impossible to find a limita-
tion with awareness that is free of elaboration. ·

So, it is taught.

Likewise, once concepts occur-whether virtuous or non virtuous, form
or whatever arises as the objects of the six organs-there is no need to
intentionally fixate upon them. According to the vehicles of mental anal-
ysis, objective appearances are intentionally arrested merely through the
intellectual doctrines of nonaffirming and affirming emptiness and others.
[s 7] The way this fails to bring about enlightenment is as stated in The All-
Creating Monarch:

| Not knowing the all-creating monarch, the six sense organs per-
| ceive the appearance of the six objects. If perceived as suffer-
| ing, the sense organs thwart it. Not knowing the all-creating
| monarch, there is no result of freedom from origination and
| cessation.

Thus, it is.

Perhaps one may think that the lack of discerning between appearances
and perceived objects seems to approach the view of the relative True Image
Mind Only School.• For instance, in the first moment of seeing a moun-
tain, an ordinary individual is powerless not to think, "This is a mountain:
In the second moment, however, through investigation of the mountain's
intrinsic nature, [s8] the strength of the mind and mental activity reach
maturity so the concept of"mountain• vanishes without a trace in its own
place. At that time, although the aspect of the appearance of the moun-
tain has not ceased, one is familiar with abiding in the nature of phenom-
ena without fixation on true existence. By purifying this as simultaneous
arising [of appearances] and [their] liberation, appearances and the mind
mingle. This is the unerring path of the natural Great Perfection.

The vidyadhara Garab Dorje said:

| At the time of arising, simultaneous arising is devoid of good or bad.
| At the time of liberating, simultaneous liberating is devoid of good or bad.

So, it is.

Therefore, without relying upon attempts to cleanse temporary obstruct-
ing stains by engaging in the difficulties of accepting or rejecting, this is
more sublime than the tainted discipline that binds one to the mental atti-
tude of considering what to guard and what will degenerate. [s9] Here,
the sole vital essenceb of the wisdom intent of the king of the great vehi-
cle includes the path of the paramitas, all methods of conduct, and the
prajfia of samadhi-all of which are complete within the king of supreme
recollection, the nature of awareness. It states in the Sutra ofthe Special
Request:

| Without fixation is generosity; without abiding is discipline;
| unguarded is patience; without effort is diligence; without focus
| is concentration; without conceptualization is prajna.

Thus, with the support of scriptural quotations such as this, it appeals to
scholars and opens the eyes of the dull-minded. [6o]

The way of dirccdy engaging this nature of phenomena with the
four modes of placement is as explained in the Lamp 1hat Illuminates
Appearances:

| Placement like a mountain is the extent of the view; placement
| of meditation like the ocean is the extent of meditation; place-
| ment of appearances is the extent of conduct; placement of
| awareness is the extent of the result. The practitioner possessing
| these four extents merges with the definitive meaning.

Thus, through placement of the view like a mountain one is introduced
to how things arc free of mental activity. The great self-radiance of aware-
ness is not subject to the effort of mental fixation or intentional mcdita-
tional antidotes. Place [awareness] in this total openness free of transition
or change.

Through placement of meditation like the ocean, [61] the body sits in
the lotus posture and the eyes gaze dirccdy into the vacuity of space with-
out creating a false trap of fixation on the perceptions of the six senses.
Abiding like the ocean unaffected by the movement of waves, the mind
is allowed to be lucid and pristine. Through placement in the upadesha
of conduct, allow the three doors to suddenly relax and sustain naked
cognizant wisdom that is exposed from the sheath of the view and medi-
tation. Through placement of the uncontrivcd result, by allowing the five
objects to remain natural, inner naked radiance actually dawns. As the five
winds41 become bound within basic space, even the dear-light purity of
one's own appearances will arise according to the common sccrct'42 in the
form of smoke, mirages, rainbows, and the like. [ 62.]

In brief, since me innate nature is free from activity, me way in which
me three doors decisively settle within me expanse of spontaneous great
evenness is a significant key point of me natural Great Perfection estab-
lished through me twelve great modes of vajra laughter and me eight great
words mat purely define me eight groups of consciousness. This immedi-
ate awareness mat uanscends cause, result, accepting, or rejecting is taken
as me pam free from uansition or change throughout me three times.
Concerning mis, me great Lord of me FamUy, me omniscient Sover-
eign of Speech, 43 said mat all great practitioners who have arrived at this
nature [ 63] such as Padma,44 Vimalamitra, Tilopa, and so forth have openly
taught that mere is no cause, result, virtue, or nonvirtue. He also stated
mat, although mis may be realized intellectually, having not yet arrived
at that state through experience, we must take care to observe me subtle
workings of cause and result while not fearing me innate nature.
Thus, as taught by explaining how to discern me two uuths, those of
dull faculty will eventually come to understand this. The way this occurs
is, if those of dull intellect identify whatever passions arise and leave them
in their own place, in doing so the nature of the passion is rendered objec-
tively baseless from me root. [64] The wisdom intent where passions arc
rendered pure will then be maintained and me skill to do so improved. All
of those with superior faculties will know mat the characteristic of what-
ever passions and concepts arise will be unable to materialize through the
key point of me nature of phenomena being free in its own place. Just as
a knot in a horse's tail loosens of its own accord-since arising and liber-
ation awaken impartially, it is unnecessary to reapply any antidote. Here,
there is nothing to seal as wim me mind class and nothing to focus on in
the space of phenomena as wim the expanse class; through me upadesha
[class], mis is determined at the level of experience that rests free from
mental focus. When one is familiar wim this, it is as stated in The AU-Cre-
ating Monarch:

... unaltered, untrained, spontaneously perfect awareness.

Thus, as taught, [ 6s] on the ground of uncultivated and unaccomplishcd
awareness-since everything is subsumed within the one nature of wis-
dom-mere is no need to intentionally practice the ten bodhisattva
grounds and paths through me effort-based generation and completion
stages of me outer and inner classes of mantra.

Meditation on Togal

Second, to explain the path of the great clear light of togal, there are two
divisions: the ways this is more sublime than trekcho and the actual excep-
tional path.

First, the great Omniscient One asserts that there arc seven ways [togal]
is more sublime. If presented here, through trekcho, there is no poten-
tial to purify the objects of confused perception such as mountains, boul-
ders, earth, and so forth. The difference is that. through togal, appearances
arise as five lights.' [66] That which is called ·awareness that is primordial
dear light" is determined through trekcho to be nonconccptual empti-
ness that is merely lucid. In togal by emphasizing the key points, the dif-
ference is that the wisdom avenue opens and the nature of phenomena is
witnessed through radiance. With trekcho, one searches for the clarity of
having abandoned the confused projections of the impure avenues of the
six sense organs. The difference is that, with togal, since the entranceway of
pure clear light is opened through the wisdom wind, the unimpeded sense
organs are able to utilize the appearance of the indivisibility of space and
wisdom as the four luminosities.

With trekcho, because one is dependent upon the coarse winds and
channels, deviations and hindrances breed. [67] Once that occurs, due to
the strength of the elements, there will be dependency upon age. Here
[with togal], since coarseness is the object to abandon, at the moment of
binding through the key point of the three states of motionlessness, one
takes the path of the genuine wisdom of winds and channels free from the
effort of fixating. Therefore, the difference is that the body is liberated as
dear light by exhausting all coarseness.

With trekcho, if the luminosities do not achieve their full extent, it is
still possible for liberation from the physical body to occur. However, even
though the body docs dissolve into particles, it is impossible to dissolve
into clear light. Without dissolution into clear light, the temporary kar-
mic body, [68] the contaminated sense constituents, and so forth cannot
reach the ultimate ground. One who is unable to attain the vajra body of
the great transference endowed with great waves of clairvoyance, the eye of
prajfia, and miraculous powers is incapable of accomplishing great waves
of benefit for the welfare of others. Observe the difference between the

Lord of All Victors, Padmasambhava, and the mahasiddhas of India and Tibet.

To summarize, even within Atiyoga-of the three classes of mind,
expanse, and upadesha-the mind class [emphasizes] the platitude of one's
own clarity while the expanse class relies on freedom from the ground.
Neither one direcdy realizes awareness. Even with the three [of the four]
cycles of the upadesha class, there is the expectation of liberation in the
bardo. Here, since there is the key point of liberation in the light body,
[69] the unconfused result will be discovered through the path of con-
fused perception. This difference will be understood by those who possess
eyes of prajfia.

For the second, there are four: the important points for toga! [prac-
tice], the path that reveals the actual key points, the signs that delineate the
stages of the four luminosities, and the supplementary upadeshas.

Important Pointsfor Togal

For the first, the key point of this king of all vehicles is to discern between
mind and wisdom. The intrinsic nature of the mind is the radiance of
the nature of phenomena; but, when united with the winds, [the mind]
becomes like a crippled person that has mounted a blind, unruly horse.
[70] In this way, [the mind] is not separate from discursive thoughts.
Concerning this, within the lungs is a channel that resembles a shaft
of wheat filled with wind and is the source for all breathing. From that
channel, by the strength of the expansion of individual networks of chan-
nels, there comes to be the objective appearances of the five organs which
assume the functionality of the passions and karma. It states in the Charnel Ground That Partakes of the Aggregattes tantra:

| Even though the nature of mind is wisdom, it appears as the
| manifestation of duality. With breath as the horse, circum-
| stances are encountered.

So, it is.

Wisdom abides within the "luminosity of the flesh heart", indicating
the nature, intrinsic nature, and compassion - these three-called the
•luminosity of the fundamental nature of the ground... It is similarly stated
in the Reverberation ofSound:

| In the celestial palace of the precious heart [71] is the aspect of
| the originally pure nature. This is the radiance of the embodi-
| ment of emptiness and clarity, appearing in the manner of a vase
| body with face and hands. Abiding as a spontaneowly present
| orb of light, each color of compassion is lucid.

Thus, being naturally nonexistent, it abides only as the ground for the aris-
ing of dear light. That is why in Entering the Middle Way" it also states:

| When the mind ceases, kayas manifest.

Thus, similarly the method for purifying the wind-mind is that in all
other vehicles up to the secret cycle-although relying upon the effort-
based paths of the generation and completion stages-discursive thoughts
and their functionality are merely rendered dormant. Failing to understand
even the key point of remaining inactive [7z.] and allowing the clements
to be pure in their own place, there is delusion concerning the methods
for taking the result as the path in dependence upon the key point of the
entranceways. That is why all activities of the body, speech, and mind-
virtuous and nonvirtuous alike-must be completely forsaken. Training
with the method of calming the wind-awareness is the crucial point. In the
Clear Expanse it states:

| All outer, inner, and secret activities are completely forsaken through body, speech, and mind.

Thius, it is. In this way, within a motionless state-adopting the manner
of a corpse in a charnel ground-the activities of the three doors arc for-
saken, and the way of recognizing the path of the arising of wisdom is as
follows. [73]

The channel connecting the heart to the eyes is a wisdom channel called
the hollow crystal kati.845 In the [Prtdous] Go/Jm Rosar/ it states:

| The channel that connects the jewel to the occan46 is white.
| smooth. and hollow within. Here. the great wisdom of the vital
| essence flows unsullied by blood.

Thus. as taught. the moment the body is initially conceived. there is a knot-
ted channel of procreation that exists through the ftmction of water. [At
the knot] two eyes come into existence: the eye ofluminosity and the eye
of the clements. From the eye of the clements. the body is produced. From
the eye of luminosity the light of wisdom is illuminated. In the center of
the pupils. there arc channels resembling the horn of an ox. subde at the
base and broad at the tip. [7 4] Along with that. there is a clear. radiant.
watcrlikc channel both white and dark called the •water luminosity of the
far-reaching lasso.""

To give more details. the Omniscient One has said:

| Through the pure light channel. the appearance of wisdom can
| be sustained. From that support. the perception of confusion
| occurs. Therefore. those with prajna will know that there arc
| these two aspects of the support and the supported.

Thus. this teaching is even referred to in the Heart Essence Tantrtf itself as follows:

| That which connects the heart to the eyes is the great
| naturally occurring." secret wisdom channel called the hollow crystalkati.

Thus. these wisdom perspectives are extremely compatible. [75)

That which naturally occurs indicates the clear-light channel not gen-
erated through root cause and contributing circumstances. Through this
interdependence, the way that the four luminosities arise, such as the
"luminosity of the empty vital cssencc,..-like the fan of a peacock-is as
stated in the Naturally Arising:

| The four luminosities arc as follows: the luminosity of the empty
| vital essence, of the space of awareness,b ofself-emergent prajna,
| and the water luminosity of the far-reaching lasso-all ofwhich
| abide within every living being.

So, it is.

The fact that even the subtlest support of the water luminosity of the
far-reaching lasso can perceive things as large as mountains, houses, and
the like is due to the subtle aspcctofthewinds. Ultimately, [76] by purify-
ing the four elements-including karmic winds-this matures as the four
luminosities due to the wisdom wind. By perfecting the strength of the
four visions, which are the support for (the luminosities], arriving at the
ground of exhaustion, the manner in which the pith decision occurs is as
stated in the (Treasury ofthe] Precious Gmuine Meaning:•

| First, it is necessary for the visions of togal to arise. It is then
| necessary to be without fixation during meditation. Finally, it
| is essential that everything becomes exhausted. Since awareness
| is combined with winds in order to achieve the immutable rest-
| ing place, it is necessary to purify the aspect of winds. With the
| increase of the aspect of the radiance of awareness, it is once
| again necessary that [the radiance of awareness] reach exhaus-
| tion in inner basic space. This wisdom intent is difficult to com-
| prehend. Due to the kindness of the guru, [ 77] atter a long time
| I was also able to realize this.

Thus, it is.

These exceptional appearances of the dear-light, natural Great Perfec-
tion are referred to in a hidden way in many of the great tantric treatises
such as the Magical Manifestation Matrix of Manjushri.d Even though
nothing exists within the nature of awareness, those completely blinded
by pride will-through mental imputation-claim that the origin of this
doctrine is based on delusion. Such claims arc utter stupidity.

Just as it is characteristic of the nature of the moon's waxing and waning
to naturally occur, likewise, within the nature of awareness, the character-
istics of the three: kayas originally occur. Therefore, once existing in this
way, [78] whUc: perfecting the proficiency of the sambhogakaya's quali-
ties as the appearances on the path, the vision of the direct realization
[of the actual nature of phenomena] up to the [vision of the] complete
extent is analogous to the waxing moon reaching maturity. The absolute
perfection of the exhaustion in the nature of phenomena as the innate
dharmakaya is analogous to the moon on the thirtieth day having van-
ished in space. (47)

Path That Reveals the Actual Key Points

For the second, there arc four: revealing the key point of the three doors,
observing clear light through the three key points, dirccdy encountering
awareness through the empowerment conferral of the energy of awareness,
and the supplementary, concluding summary.

Revealing the Key Point ofthe Three Doors

For the first, there arc three inner divisions. First, if one is unable to control
the key point of the body, there will be no ability to control the key point
of the channels. [79] If the channels arc not controlled, one will be unable
to control the key point of both winds and awareness. Without control,
clear light will not be fully evident; therefore, one must take care to apply
the key point of the body. As it states in the Garland ofPearls:•

| The three key points assumed for the body arc the posture of a
| lion, elephant, and sage.

Thus, these three will be taught beginning with the dharmakaya posture of
the lion. Assuming an air of greatness, crouch; and, by joining the soles of
bothfccttogcthcrin front, thcmobilitywindissupprcsscd.Bystraightening
the body, the winds arc able to 8ow freely. Allowing the weight of the head
to rest upon the neck is a powerful way to arrest concepts. Clenching the
fingers into fists [So] and placing them where both feet join together at the
soles balances the physical clements.

The Omniscient One said, "Some assert that placing the soles of the
feet on the ground and squatting with both palms touching the ground to
the right and left of the feet [is an alternative posture]. It seems that they
fatlcd to fully comprehend this wisdom intent." Thus, it is necessary to
analyze this.

The sambhogakaya posture that resembles a sleeping elephant is that, by
joining the knees to the chest, the blissful heat and clements are enriched
and vitalized. Placing both elbows on the ground equalizes the male,
female, and neutral winds. Using palms to support the chin arreSts the
coarse winds. Both feet pointing straight back with soles upward balances
feelings oflcthargy and agitation. [81]

The nirmanakaya posture that resembles that of a sage is that, by sit-
ting in a crouching position, the channels and winds arc balanced. Placing
the soles of the feet on the ground suppresses the water clement. Keeping
the backbone straight allows the wind-mind to flow as the nature of phe-
nomena. By joining the knees to the chest, heat and winds blaze as wis-
dom. Pulling the lower belly slightly into the spine severs the continuity of
thoughts. Linking the arms and covering the knees dispels imbalances of
the heat clement. In this posture, touching under the armpits dispels cold
diseases. Placing the two elbows upon the knees, clenching the fists, and
supporting the esophagus balance heat and cold. [ 82.]

In this way, for all of these postures, remaining relaxed without being
too tight or forceful is an important key point to avoid hindrances.

Furthermore, there are many postures such as the "fully awakened .. and
the ·unchanging vajra.'"b Nevertheless, since this is the wisdom intent of
those who arc considered the heirs of the tantra, for those who enjoy an
unelaborate approach the above-prescribed methods alone will suffice.

The specific qualities of these postures are as stated in the R~verbera
tion of Sound:

| With the dharmakaya lion posture, there is freedom from all
| fear of confusion, [83] allowing the ability to sec with the vajra
| eye. The sambhogakaya posture that relics upon the manner of
| a sleeping elephant utilizes the meaning of the nature of phe-
| nomena, allowing the ability to see with the lotus eye. The
| nirmir)akiya posture relies upon the manner of a crouching
| sage, [and] the nature of phenomena manifests as appearances,
| allowing the ability to see with the dharma eye.

Second, the key point of speech is as stated in the root tantra:

| Speech must rely upon training, enduring, and determining.

Thus, if silence is not maintained, in dependence [upon speech] con·
cepts, disturbances, disputes, [84] idle chatter, and so forth prolif-
erate. Since these four obstructions will occur, one must train in the
stages that reduce speech. Some individuals are extremely addicted to
the elaborations of speech. If so, first, they should go to an uninhabited
place. There, they should intentionally invoke and shout out whatever
their favorite subjects are some hundreds, thousands, and millions of
times. Once exhausted, they will lose interest in speaking, speech will
be reduced, and eventually they will even be inclined to give up the reci-
tation of dharma liturgy. [For one] content to remain like a mute, the
movement of the winds will slow down and then cease. As stated in the
Ckar Expanse [8s]:

| Those who penetrate the key point of speech in this way will
| exhaust verbal circumstances and be led beyond sorrow.

Third, the key points that correspond to the mind are as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The mind is directed toward outer space while inner luminosity directly appears.

Thus, when the mind energized by winds-the essence of which is aware·
ness-is directed toward external space, the wind ofmobility becomes very
calm and the uncompounded, clear empty radiance of inner luminosity
clearly dawns as the union of space and awareness. It is similarly stated in
the Ckar Expanse:

| By penetrating the key points of the mind in this way, awareness
| of the three kayas will appear as emptiness. [ 86]

Observing Clear Light through the three key points

Second, observing clear light through the three key points is as stated in
the Reverberation of Sound:

| One must rely upon the key points of the entranceway, object,
| winds, and awareness.

[The key points] are delineated here by commas, whereas other texts refer
to them as actual terms. Therefore, four [rather than three] key points are
optional.

When the three key points originate as terms, they are as follows:

| When winds and awareness are relaxed, wisdom will be achieved.

Thus, from the perspective of the single function of [winds and aware-
ness], this is explained as three [entranceway, object, and winds and aware-
ness as one]. This way of categorizing is not contradictory. In addition,
there are other ways to establish this.

Concerning that, first there is the key point of the entranceway for aris-
ing as stated in the root tantra: [ 87]

| The key point of the entranceway is to gaze upward, downward, and sideways.

Thus, since the dharmakaya possesses the eye of the nature of phenomena,
the manner of gazing is upward toward the crown of the head. 41 This is a
key point for the downward dispelling of habits. Since the sambhogakaya
possesses the eye of wisdom, the manner of gazing is direcdyoutward. This
is a key point for mingling sarpsara and enlightenment as one taste. Since
the nirmiJ)akaya has the eye ofprajna, the manner of gazing is downward.
This is a key point for direcdy ascertaining the appearance of wisdom.

The key point of the entranceway does not end here. If one were to
encounter the inner meaning, it states in the Garland [of Pearls]:

| Appearing from the crown aperture of exaltation, the unceasing
| chain of awareness is nonconcc:ptual. [88]

Thus, indicated by the entranceway for the wisdom of transference, the
radiance of the nature of emptiness arises from the: central channel of light.
From within the channel of the: lungs, the radiant awareness of compas-
sion arises. Based on these descriptions, it states in the Sun, Moon, Plan-
ets, and Stars:

| Recognizing the two ordinary channels of the eyes as the path is
| a limitation, indicating a lack of understanding.

Thus, it is taught. Although this point is made, at the present time of prac-
tice, two gateways are sufficient. As it states:

| With eyes halfopen, look at the: sun. [Appearances will be] lucid
| like constellations in the cast

So, the key point is, with eyes half open, direct the gaze to a distance one
cubit away from the: sun. [ 89] The sign that the key point of the entrance-
way has been accomplished will be that one: is able to gaze at the object
indefinitely.

Second, the: key point of the object, which is the basis for the arising,
is that in a place free: from nonconducivc circumstances-lofty, dear, and
open-in late summer and fall before the harshness of winter, as well as
in the springtime, a beginner should practice by gazing at the two rays 4'
in pure space: completely devoid of circumstances such as clouds or wind.
Once the space-awareness separates from the point between the: eyebrows,
with a very relaxed face one should turn to the west in the early morning or
east in the late aficrnoon.w Free: from the: circumstance of the sense organs,
one rests in the water luminosity of the far-reaching lasso. [90] As it states
in the: Clear Expanse:

| There will be lucidity when there: is freedom from three: circumstances (58)
| The meaning to be known here is to examine the purity of the sky.

Thus, that is why this is taught.

For the third, there are two. First, the key point of the winds is that wind
is mobile so, when concepts ride this as their mount, even the essence of
the sugatas~ 2 can be lured. Therefore, the method for averting the cause of
that is the heart-essence tradition of breathing through the mouth rather
than the nostrils. Exhaling and inhaling very slowly and calmly, with lips
and teeth almost touching, is a special feature of this tradition. [91] The
difference is that, in all the upadeshas which specify wind be inhaled
through the nostrils, the wind is the object to be purified within the four
chakras. By the force of that [wind], it is easy for obstructions and faults to
occur. Here, [by bringing the wind in through the mouth], the wind that
circulates through the lungs is purified by relaxing in its place; and radi-
ance dissolves into the heart. Conceptual wind as the object to be cleansed
is purified in its place without rejection. The individual qualities of each
chakra are spontaneously present without being sought. That is a key point
for liberating wisdom wind in clear light. Maintaining long, extended
breaths without force is mentioned in the Ckar Expanse:

| When gently equalizing the Aow of the breath, breathing
| becomes slight [92.] and the coming and going of the breath
| will cease.

This is a crucial key point for rendering space-awareness motionless.
Second, the key point of awareness is that, by engaging in the modes
of gazing and the postures just explained as well as practicing according
to the three key points of the entranceway, object, and winds, one leaves
aside all responsibilities and maintains a state of complete inactivity. The
indication that existence has been perfectly liberated is that, by focusing
on the vast openness of the clear expanse of outer space, it will seem as
though awareness is dissolving. Then, an orb of very pure and radiant blue
light will initially arise. From that, the way that appearances emerge is as·
five radiant lights [93] of five colors resembling an unfurled bolt of bro-
cade cloth. This is referred to as ·inner space appearing outwardly: In the
tantras it states:

| Space is both outward and inward. Outwardly, it is like a cloud-
| less sky; while inwardly it is luminous.

Thus, it is. Because I never noticed that any [scholar-practitioners] of the
past had comprehended the meaning of this key point about outer and
inner space, I am compelled to include this quote from the guru who is
the original buddha:

| Some people identify this only as a cloudless outer sky. That per-
| spective is extremely unacceptable. The reason is that there is no
| connection between the sky and the individual [94] Whether
| there isluminosityor not depends on the individual. Here, inner
| space is the blue radiance that arises externally, called •me outer
| space: Therefore, the sky is merely the avenue for the appear-
| ance of the ground [perfectly pure space] and is not the actual
| space. Actual space is blue, and that is the inner space. In this
| way, space and the visions that arise from that are called both
| outer space and inner space. Although referred to separately, it
| should be understood to be like a tent of dull rainbow light that
| becomes increasingly more lucid. This is not like retracting the
| inner or projecting the outer. One arises from the other. Outer
| and inner appearances must be understood in this way.

So, it is.

Therefore, by understanding this, within the luminosity of pure space,
[95] that which arises as the purification of karmic wind is the luminos-
ity of the empty vital essence. Just as when a stone drops into a well of
water and circular ripples appear, rings of molecules as five-colored light
and so forth become evident. By emphasizing that with the far-reaching
gaze, extremely radiant inner awareness is experienced without material-
izing. This is the nature of the luminosity of self-emergent prajiia; and,
from that, there is the arising of sharp and rapid prajiia that comprehends
objects as well as the natural ability to know the meaning of words. This is
the energy of prajna.

Then, the awareness of true seeing" appears as the vajra chain of aware-
ness~> like a string of fine pearls or a floating golden thread. [96] This is
called the "radiance of prajna." It is necessary to recognize that, although
there is a single nature, it is distinguished in three ways. If that distinction
is not made, then it is as the Omniscient One said:

| Some say that cognition is the: prajfla luminosity that naturally
| occurs. Some say it is inner radiance. Still others call this the
| "chain of awareness." Therefore, they are confused.

Thus, it is taught. The radiance of awareness as the vajra chain that is seen
in this way shoul be positioned within the enclosure of space and the vital
essence. This meditation is a key point of awareness. In the Ckar Expans~
it states:

| The key point of awareness is to hold the vajra chain. This should
| be practiced by those whose appearances arc: rdaxed.

Thus, it is. [97]

During this time, if one falls prey to even a hair's worth of analysis
concerning the: appearance of light, then the vajra-chain awareness will
become: materialized, binding one to hindrances and pitfalls. The visions
of the luminosities arc one's own nature of phenomena itself rendered evi-
dent, so one must train in fearless conduct" without fixation. Until famil-
iar, the appearances will move like a mirage, buoyant and shimmering.
If one takes care to gradually guide this through the way of gazing, then
by achieving familiarity, however much the inner nature of the channels
vanishes into light will be how much space-awareness separates from the
point between the eyebrows. The circumstance of depending upon exter-
nal objects will decrease, thus allowing the experience of the four visions
to gradually increase. [98]

Subsequently, since this is to see through the ordinary eye, it is neces-
sary to reach the ground of exhaustion. If this is seen through the eye of
prajna, simultaneous exhaustion will occur without the certainty of grad-
ual stages. This is due to the inconceivable differences among individu-
als. However, in both cases, even for someone whose channel of ignorance
is superior, the manner of arising will still be unpredictable. That is why
one should not assume this is a sign of [perfecting] this path. Based on
the sole root cause and contributing circumstance of heat and moisture, a
seed can prematurely ripen yet become impotent. Therefore, it is crucial
to know one's level only through [consulting] the upadesha of the final
result. [99]

Directly Encountering Awareness

For the third, there are two: entering the great wisdom maJ)<;{ala of one's
own appearances and conferral of the energy of awareness empowerment'
to encounter the innate nature.
First, in a fully endowed place and time, on a mountain peak or in an
extremely remote area where it is natural for the visions"to directly emerge,
offer a ganachakrab and torma as well as a golden maJ)<;{ala to the guru and
repeat the following supplication:

| Guru, great holder of the vajra, so that I may be liberated from
| samsara, please bestow the empowerment of the energy of awareness,
| the great secret path ofVajrasattva.

After three repetitions, [100] the guru and all disciples remove their upper
garments, symbolizing that the appearance of clear light is free from the
veil of obscurity. Then, the guru gives the indication saying, ·without
blinking, gaze upon the blue syllable ahs 3 in my heart and rest your mind
without distraction!" The vajra master plays the hand drum; and, after the
descent of blessings, suddenly the master shouts the sound of phet with
great intensity and at that very instant slowly inquires three times, •What
is the mind?" When the disciples are speechless and without focus, left in
a state of shock, that sudden apparent uncontrived awareness is known as
the great seeing of that which was previously unseen; [101] which is also
called the •descent of wisdom while resting in the dharmakaya".

The actual entrance is as follows. All disciples arc asked to assume the
posture of the sage and, as they gaze into space without focus, to bring the
natural pure realm to mind. Then, the guru says,

| Eh ma hoi Listen, my heart children of great fortune! In the
| eastern direction is the extremely pleasing, magnificent pure
| land called Manifest Joy, where the conqueror Vajra Alqhobhya
| abides. He is blue and adorned with various jeweled ornaments.
| In the southern direction is the extremely pleasing, magnificent
| pure land [102.] called Endowed with Glory, where the con-
| queror Ratnasambhava abides. He is yellow, adorned with vari-
| o us jeweled ornaments. In the western direction is the extremely
| pleasing, magnificent pure land calJcd Lotus Arrangement,
| where the conqueror Amitabha abides. He is red, adorned
| with various jeweled ornaments. In the northern direction of
| the extremely pleasing, magnificent pure land called Pcrfecdy
| Complete Activity dwells the conqueror Amoghasiddhi, green,
| adorned with various jeweled ornaments. All of them abide in
| indivisible union with their consorts. [103] With assemblies as
| numerous as the immeasurable buddhas that exist upon a single
| particle, all of them are listening to their individual teachers as
| each reveals to his respective assembly the dear-light nature of
| mind and the nature of Secret Mantra just as it is. 0 sons and
| | daughters, with the gaze of an elephant, look into the eastern
| direction. Like a leaping lion, jump! With the gaze of a lion,
| look into the southern direction. Like a bounding tigress, lunge!
| With the wrathful, haughty gaze of the heruka, [104] look into
| the western direction. Fly there like a soaring garu4al With the
| gaze of Vajradhara, look into the northern pure land. Depart
| like the flash of a lightning bolt! ah ah ah

So, this is irreversibly scaled.

In this way-having been led into the four entranceways of the maQ4ala
of awareness-when a disciple with pure faith connects with a highly real-
ized vajra master, even if the disciple fails to practice in that lifetime, he or
she will be free to take rebirth in a natural nirmit;lakaya pure realm. That is
the exceptional feature of this Secret Mantra.

Entering the dharmakaya of the sambhogakaya is as follows. The disciples
arc asked to assume the vajra posture, gaze straight out into space, [Ios]
and bring the pure land of Rich Array to mind. The guru says,

| Eh ma! All fortunate children of the mind, listen! That which
| completely transcends all of this is the natural nirmar;takaya pure
| realm-the basis of the arising of everything without exception.
| Like observing one's own face [in a mirror], the pure realm of
| Rich Array is absolutely radiant, enveloped by the five aspects
| of wisdom. Completely even and motionless, it is here where
| the Bhagavan, Foe Destroyer, Exhauster of the Contaminants,
| One Gone to Bliss, Omniscient in the World, Transformer of
| Disciples to Be Tamed, Unsurpassed, [1o6] Guide of All Gods
| and Humans, the Perfecdy Enlightened One known as Buddha
| Amirabha resides. He is surrounded by a boundless assembly
| of hundreds, thousands, and millions of perfccdy enlightened
| buddhas and delights in the extremely pure manifestation of the
| nature of phenomena. 0 children, with the gaze of an elephant,
| look! Depart with the leap of a lion! ah ah ah

So, this is irreversibly scaled by [the view of] emptiness.

Entering the dharmakaya madala is as follows. The disciples arc asked
to assume the lion posture. To establish the auspicious connection for
obtaining the five sublime eyes of those on the ground of buddha.~ they
gaze upward, [107] downward, to the right, left, and directly ahead. To
introduce the wisdom of naked, empty awareness, the guru says,

| Eh ma! Fortunate heart children of the mind, listen! That
| which transcends and is far beyond the two riipakayas•ss is the
| basis from which both of them arise, the nature of one's own
| awareness,& free from mental considerations as wisdom that is
| absorbed yet unobscurcd.S' This nature of phenomena that has
| no distinctions whatsoever is immeasurable, boundless, and
| nonconccprual. Disciples, in this innate nature free from des-
| tination, check to determine who is the traveler and then rest.
| By understanding empty awareness, hold fast to the key point!
| [108] Without any hindrance, train! With clear wisdom, train
| on the path! With manifold phenomena, do not fixate! Within
| the inconceivable .•• ah ah.

So, the guru speaks.

When one receives empowerment in this maQcjala, ignorance is cleansed
in the ground, awareness increases as wisdom, and one is empowered to
actually meditate. Through this, even those with weak famUiarity will be
liberated in the bardo. The most supreme wUI be liberated in this very
lifetime.

For the second. all disciples arc asked to carcfuUy assume the postures of
the three doors and the ways of gazing. [109] In order to indicate the key
points of the greatness of clear-light togal. the guru says.

| Kye! Fortunate children of the mind, listen! In the innate secret
| ofthe precious heart dwells the seed of the wisdom vital essence.
| From the perspective of the nature, this is empty and sclftcss;
| and, from the perspective of the intrinsic nature, this is unceas-
| ingly radiant. From the compassionate manifestation, insepa-
| rable kayas and wisdom arc aii-Uiuminating like a lamp within
| a vase. The four luminosities arc naturally clear as they emerge
| from the precious crystal channel of radiant light. Through this,
| dirccdy encountering the nature ofphenomena ofthe unceasing
| ornamental wheel of the enlightened body. speech, and mind
| of all sugatas; you have received the great empowerment of the
| energy of awareness. [110]

How docs this occur? The clear light of wisdom-awareness is Buddha Vai-
rochana. That unchanging nature is Buddha Ak~hobhya. The ever-increas-
ing dear-light radiance is Buddha Ratnasambhava. The immeasurable
appearance of light is Buddha Amitabha. Being perfect and unsought in
itself is Buddha Amoghasiddhi. In this way, the faces of all five buddhas
arc dirccdy realized.

Even the nature of this wisdom appearing as stainless awareness is the
mirror. 57 As the nonduality of clear light and the nature. this is the (wis-
dom of] evenness. As the arising of distinct details, this is discerning wis-
dom. Being spontaneowly present and unsought is all-accomplishing
activity [wisdom]. [m] Primordially empty and baseless is the basic space
of phenomena. This is the nature of the five aspects of wisdom.

The essence [that is] unchanging is thevajra.~lhcqualities fully endowed
are ratna. Appearances untainted by any stain are padma. That there is no
other accomplishment aside from this is the karma family. Because all of
this is the: path that all buddhas have traversed, it is the buddha family.
Because clear light is stainless, it is whitc.s9 Because qualities arc per-
fected, it is yellow. Abiding without being sought is red. As the: perfected
skill of activity, it is green. As unchanging and firm, it is blue.

The way [awareness] abides as the five: winds is as foUows. [I I2.] That these
visions of clear light have: never been separate from the warmth of wisdom
is the heat-assimilating wind. 60 That the life of sarpsara and enlightenment
is maintained is the life-sustaining wind. That the discernment is made
between the pure and poUutc:d aspects of s:upsara and enlightenment is
the pure- and impure-distinguishing wind. That awareness pervades every-
thing is the: all-pervasive wind. That the life: ofsal}lsara is severed and one is
led beyond sorrow is the merciless karmic wind of the kalpa.

The way this abides as the five states of prajiia is as foUows. Based on
realizing the nature of clear light or not, by discerning between sarpsara
and enlightenment, there: is the prajfia of discerning. Through the: vision of
the increasing manifestation and so forth, the appearances of the: energy of
wisdom are gathered as the: prajfia of gathering. [113] By pervading every-
thing, there is all-pervasive prajfia. Through the: motion of the visions of
light going and coming, there is the: prajfia of movement. If this is realized,
to be liberated from sarJlsara is the prajfia of liberation. These are the six
groups of five:.

Furthermore, since the blue: light is understood to be Buddha J:)akini,
by including the other four aspects of awareness, one sees the faces of the:
five 9akini purifiers of the objects to be cleansed. All these categories of
seven groups of five are the inherent nature: of awareness as the path.

The: way of establishing resultant appearances as ultimate perfection is
also stated in the Clear Expanse:

| From the: self-manifestation of naturally occurring awareness, 
| the five kayas and five aspects ofwisdom, five families, five lights,
| [114] five winds, five prajfias, and so forth abide.

In brief. this indwelling nature of phenomena is not the designing intel-
lect of the mental experience of empty form that is analytically designated
nor docs it originate from interdependency based on fixating with effort
in practices involving the channels and winds. The originally established
experience of the visions that directly realize the undeniable nature of
phenomena renders evident the phenomena of the path and result begin-
ning with perfecting refuge in the Three Jewels according to the teachings
of Buddha up to the ten topics of the ocean of tantric classifications.61 The
way this occurs is as stated in the Sixfold Expanse: [us]

| The primordially perfect buddha, dharma, and sangha abide as
| one's own body.

Thus, the unconfused nature of the mind is the ground of buddhahood,
uanscending sounds and words is the genuine dharma, and freedom from
vacillation is the essence of sangha. This is unlike those who take refuge
momentarily through interest, anger, or delusion.

Never separate from the vajra refuge of the fundamental nature, within
that one engages in the clear light of the four visions. This way of engaging
is as stated in the Lamp That Illuminates Appearances:

| Primordially, this is the way of arising. Without originating
| through the efforts of individuals, [u6] this is the maJ)qala as
| well as the deity; this is mantra, mudra, and offering; this is the
| generation and completion stages; the buddha, sentient beings,
| satpSara, and enlightenment; empowerment, vows, and samaya;
| this is one's guru as well as the deity.

Thus, it is.

Therefore, one should never be apart from the appearance of the vajra
chain of awareness in the center of the vital essence ofbasic space. As stated
in the Arrangement ofColorfuljewels:•

| If you wish to sec the mind of all buddhas, gaze at the kaya of
| the vajra chain of awareness. If you wish to internalize the wis-
| dom intent of all buddhas, never be separate from the vajra
| chain of awareness. If you wish to fully comprehend all aspects
| of the dharma, both concisely and extensively, observe the
| way in which the vajra chain of awareness abides. [n7] If you
| wish to be learned in all of wisdom's secrets, observe the rays
| of the vajra chain of awareness. If you aspire towards insepara-
| ble view, meditation, and conduct, don't be distracted from the
| kaya of the vajra chain of awareness. If you wish to behold the
| celestial palace of all phenomena, internalize the genuine mean-
| ing of space and awareness. If you wish to inherit the lineage of
| Vajrasattva, remain ever one with the kaya of the vajra chain of
| awareness.

Thus, it is taught. In this way, directly seeing the meaning of awareness of
the nature of phenomena is referred to as b.eing equal to the original pro-
tector, Kuntuzangpo. It states in the Secrtt Conduct:' [n8]

| Whoever sees in this way is equal in fortune with the original
| protector, Kuntuzangpo.

Thus, as stated [by the guru],

| Today, the greatest discovery has occurred! Receiving the
| empowerment of the energy of awareness is like encountering
| the faces of three thousand buddhas. By severing the cycle of
| rebirth, you have seized the path that leads to liberation. Even
| if you were to gradually traverse the ten bodhisatrva grounds, it
| is still not certain you would directly perceive all qualities of the
| essence of the sugatas. Therefore, from this day onward, perse-
| vere in the practice of the ultimate qualities of the four visions
| [119] to reach the state of awakening in the exhaustion of the
| nature of phenomena!

So, [the disciples] are filled with inspiration.

Next, there are two ways to insure that the practice is on track. First,
training in four sessions for those who practice with elaborations is as
stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The way to insure that the practice of virtue is on uack is to train
| in four sessions.

Thus, for that, during the first phase of the predawn, meditate on guru
yoga. In the second phase, maintain trekcho; and, in the final phase, medi-
tate upon empty bliss and the fierce wisdom: From dawn to sunup. recite
daily sadhanas, prayers, and so forth; and, &om morning until noon, prac-
tice toga!. In the late afiernoon, [120] perform prostrations and other vir-
tuous activities. In the evening, practice toga) again. At night, offer torma
and hold the winds. During the first phase of dusk, meditate on imper-
manence; and, for the second phase, practice generation stage and mantra
recitation. In the late evening session, mingle sleep with innate clear light.

In all cases, begin each session by generating bodhichitta while main-
taining the actual practice with nonconceptual awareness. In conclu-
sion, end all sessions with dedication of merit and aspiration prayers. This
is known as •practice united with the three sacred stages.• These [three
stages] arc indispensable.

Second, being without elaborations is as stated in the Lamp 1hat Illu-
minates Appearances:

| Just like the continuum of day and night ...
 
Thus, this is the field of experience for those who are experiencing the
warmth of the fundamental nature [121] and who only train in dear-light
togal practice. By forsaking all daily activities and never parting from the
postures, awareness rests inexpressibly in the expanse of the kayas and vital
essence. Dividing the night into three sections, at dusk, assume the posture
of a sage. The key point for controlling the sense organs is to visualize in
your navel an extremely hot red ahtungb 61 upon a four-petaled red lotus.
From that, fire blazes up the central channel penetrating the syllable ham
in the crown. Drops of the vital essence fluid fuel the fire that blazes pro-
fusely, incinerating all karma and habits. Rest within empty bliss.

In the: middle of the night, [122] assume the lion posture and gather
all knowable things within the vase as follows. Visualize that, within the
heart, there is an extremely radiant white ah. Also, visualize a white ah at
the crown aperture. Between these two, within the central channel, visual-
ize an unbroken chain of crystal-white ahs that dissolve one into the other.
Due to this, the central channel becomes dear like the sun shining through
a window. This is a key point for mingling sleep with innate dear light.

In the predawn, at the very moment of awakening, say ha with three
extended exhalations. Then, assuming the lion posture, imagine that, from
the ah in the heart, a secondah emerges and remains perfectly poised [123]
about a bow's length above the crown of the head. Focus the mind there.

Similarly, in order to develop the four states of concentration and the
wisdom of nonconceptual cessation, the key point for exhausting the five
branch winds in their own place is as follows. Envision that five red ahs are
stacked one upon the other, [indicating] the dement fire; four white [ahs]
are stacked, [indicating] the element water; three green [ahs] are stacked,
[indicating] the element wind; and two yellow [ahs] arc stacked, [indicat-
ing] the element earth. Then, imagine a single blue ah, [indicating] the
clement space. Meditate sequentially in this way because the syllable ah
abides as the unborn nature and mental analysis resembles fire, the expe-
rience of joy and bliss resembles water, recollections resemble wind, and
[124] being bound by the antidote of mindfulness resembles earth. This
is a key point for purifying that which is to be abandoned, including the
antidote, taken from the extraordinary wisdom intent of the great pandita
Vimalamitra.

During this practice, increasing the advantageous circumstances even
through conduct is as stated in the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon:

| With conduct like a honeybee, experience the taste of all phe-
| nomena. With conduct like a deer, abandon all objects that
| become the condition for confusion. With conduct like a mute,
| forsake all confused speech. With conduct like a finch, sever
| doubt with the secret method. With conduct like a lunatic,
| [us] forsake a permanent location. With conduct like a lion,
| reject a fearful mind and wander in the charnel grounds. With
| conduct like a dog or pig, eliminate concepts of dean or foul

Supplementary, Concluding Summary

Thus, there are seven stages from the conduct of a beginner who is like a
honeybee and has just begun listening and contemplating up to the con-
duct of a great practitioner for whom bliss, suffering, good, and bad are a
single taste. By assessing conduct according to one's own mind, the view
and meditation will be enhanced accordingly.

Signs That Delineate the Stages ofthe Four Luminosities

Third, the explanation delineating the four luminosities is as follows. In
the Reverberation ofSound it states:

| From this, the four visions manifest. Through the vision of the
| actual nature of phenomena,• [126] the rhetoric of the gtasping,
| analytical mind is transcended. Through the increasing experi-
| enceb of the vision, confused phenomena vanish and the wis-
| dom of the bardo is actualized. Through the vision of the full
| extent of awareness,• one transcends the appearances of the path
| of conceptualizing the three kayas. Through the vision of the
| exhaustion of the nature of phenomena,d one severs the conti-
| nuity of the three realms of saqlSara.

Thus, the four distinctions are based on the object to be purified and the
result of purification. Although [the path of the four visions] is similar to
the five paths of the prajnaparamita vehicle, the distinction between them
as slow versus swift is like the pace of a carriage versus the sun and moon.

Among these four visions of the natural, supreme sovereign of all vehi-
cles, the first is the vision of the actual nature of phenomena, as follows.

Vision ofthe Actual Nature of Phenomema

The vision of the actual nature of phenomena is [127] that-by training
with the daytime supports of the dharmakaya, the sun and a fire crystal.
and the nighttime supports of the sambhogakaya, the moon and a water
crystal-the obstacle of heat increasing in the eyes during the daytime is
removed so that the temperature of the [eyes] is normal. In the morning
and evening-whUe observing with the nirm~akaya support, a butter
lamp-it is advantageous to practice the path of exertion. In all cases, by
initially famUiarizing with the object to gaze upon, take care not to focus
too closely. Gradually, bring the light just below or close to the side [of the
object]. WhUe doing so, if the color white is predominant. then look to the
right; if yellow is predominant, look above; if green, to the left; and, if red,
look below. If the color blue is predominant, [12.8] look to the center. Ifall
five colors equally appear, just leave it as is. If the appearance of the vital
essence is not seen, then gazing equally with both eyes is the key point.
Once the radiance of the essence of the sugatas in the heart is first seen as
the vision of basic space resembling a pattern of rainbow colors, thereaf-
ter the circular light of the luminosity of the empty vital essence and three
connected subdc vital essences will occasionally appear to be clear whUe
other times obscured.

In the intermediate regions of all of this-like the sun and its rays-is
the inexpressible empty radiance of the awareness of original purity, the
awareness of true seeing appearing as the vajra chain. Like a face and its
reflection in a mirror, [119] the aspect and the nature are one and the same.
From the point of view of interdependence, it is necessary to know this
is why the vajra chain of awareness is referred to as "the cause• whUc also
being •the result.• Until an individual realizes this key point, they will fix-
ate upon the nature of phenomena as something substantial, becoming
caught in obscurity. Such an individual fails to approach the direction of
the phUosophical tenets of the Great Perfection.

Therefore, with awareness dependent upon the key point of the chan-
nels, the indication of liberation is that [the channels] arc narrow and
curved, although subdc. Relying upon the vital essence, the indication of
liberation is that-at the place where they arc curved-two subdc vital
essences connect. Relying upon the key point of the winds, the indication
of liberation [130] is that there wUI be movement. Without allowing
[awareness] to wander, through famUiarity it will be brought into the
enclosure of space and the vital essence. The radiance of all luminosities will
cffordcssly become clearer and steadier. As the three doors relax in their
own place by the arising of the samadhis of bliss, clarity, and no thoughts,
extraordinary analytical prajfia becomes manifest and the mastery of a
great degree of wisdom is gained. At this time, even if there is an interrup-
tion,') liberation in a natural nirm~akaya pure realm will occur. This is
not merely due to the first indication of the appearance of outer space. This
is due to the key point [131] that the truth is being seen through the inner
eye of prajfia, free from obscuring factors. It states in the Clear Expanse:

| Actually seeing awareness is such that, due to the key point of
| seeing the truth, there will be no return to the: three realms.

Thus, it is.

The Increasing Experience ofthe Vision

Second, the increasing experience of the vision is as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| With the increasing vision, determine the degree to which the
| experience is enhanced.

Thus, otherwise bliss, clarity, and no thoughts are generated through the
gathering of wind-mind. The experience of that arc the ten signs of having
purified the object of purification such as smoke, mirages, and so forth.

Since this involves mental fixation, the way this is not liberation is stated
in the Clear Expanse:

| The intellect is explained as the confused relative. [132.]

Thus, it also states in 1he Bodhisattva's Way ofLift:•

| The genuine is not the domain of the intellect.

Thus, it is as taught.

Here, the natural Great Perfection is stated in the tantras:

| Through the arising of the vision of emptiness from within, the
| radiance of wisdom is luminous from without.

Thus, when the inner empty nature of phenomena becomes apparent, that
radiance is the intrinsic nature of clear wisdom, unchanging and increas-
ingly outward. Inwardly, the channels become as clear as light; and, secretly,
the passions arc liberated. Since this occurs simultaneously, it does not rely
upon mental analysis. Due to gaining undeniable certainty, this is referred
to as the "vision of the experience.· The way this increases is stated in the
root tantra: [134] With the ever-increasing experience of the vision, the colors of
wisdom arise externally, vertically, horizontally, unilaterally, and
as varieties of vital essences and kayas that uanscend the objec-
tivity of coarse appearances.

Thus, as the appearance of light increases, space and awareness separate
from the point between the eyebrows.64 Lights of the five colors appear
horizontally, vertically, spherically, like stiipas, locwes with a thousand
petals, like palaces,'~ spears and arrowheads, latticework, like the dots on
dice, and so forth. All these appearances are unpredictable. In addition,
the luminosity of the vital essences appears to be the size of a bean [134]
which gradually increases to the size of a shield. Awareness becomes like a
bird taking flight, a deer running in the mountains, the slow movement of
a sharaJ)a," and the gradual descent of a honeybee upon a Rower.
In brief, however familiar one is with the practice, the vision of light
increases. With relaxation into awareness, there is some familiarity, termed
"having a sense of familiarity: The indication of supreme familiarity is as
stated in the Lamp That Illuminates Appearances:

| At the moment that all appearances arise as vital essences and
| abide as a rich array, this indicates supreme familiarity.

Thus, it can be determined that, wherever one looks, the empty atmo-
sphere [135] is pervaded by the vision of clear light occurring without
movement or vacillation. Then, when the vision of space arises like mus-
lin, it is a key point to gaze in front if the appearances arise horizontally. If
they are square, look to the right; if shaped like a half moon, above; if tri-
angular, below; ifcircular, to the left; iflike a tower, look directly out.

If distinctions arc made concerning the indication of liberation based
upon the degree of familiarity, it is as follows. When space and aware-
ness separate from the point between the eyebrows, the appearance of
the "union of the four aspects of wisdom• brings liberation such that
thereafter s:upsara is not reentered. When arising with angular shapes,
liberated [136] within the appearance of the group formations, there is
liberation in the natural nirmaQakaya pure realm. When all appearances
mature as five lights and the vision of space is perfectly circular, [appear-
ances] arise as group formations, each adorned with four-petaled lotuses.
At the first instant of the arising of clear light, there will be no bardo and
liberation will occur. As the wisdom intent of the Sok H~ir ofth~ Bud-
dha tantra, it states:

| How could it be possible for a fortunate one who has separa-
| ted [space and awareness] four finger-widths from the eye-
| brows to reenter sarpsara? Whoever sees the angular shapes will
| accomplish the noble qualities of the nirm:il)akaya. Whoever
| sees objective appearances as group formations will be as just
| mentioned.

So, it is.

For this reason, the great scholar Vimalamitra asserts [137] that the
appearance of group formations just mentioned is the fruition of the
increasing experience; and, once kayas arise, that is the full extent of aware-
ness [vision]. The great master Padma asserts that from the union of male
and female deity up to the time that the increasing appearances are com-
plete is referred to as "reaching the full extent of awareness." He also states
that the solitary deities could be the increasing experience of the vision. I
perceive [their assertions] as a single wisdom intent. In the C/~ar Expans~
it states:

| When the vision ofkayas arises and increases to perfection, that
| is when the bardo appearances are exhausted, the sambhogakaya
| is recognized, and the bardo is emptied.

Thus, the arisingofkayas is an indisputable indication [138] that the vision
of the increasing experience has reached its conclusion as well as implicitly
indicating the beginning of the full extent. Analogous to seeing a moun-
tain on the opposite side of a valley from both directions, the appearance
of the solitary kaya of a deity depends upon both visions because of the
interdependent nature of this accomplishment. The Omniscient One
clearly defined the distinction between the wisdom intent of the two mas-
ters.(67) All followers who don't understand how to assess the comparisons
concerning genuine basic space conceitedly blun out, trying to convince
themselves that they know something. Their efforts are like child's play. As
the external strength of the visions of dear light increases, the inner dear
light of awareness [139] also arises as samadhi, clairvoyance, omniscience,
and the like.

Vision ofthe Full Extent ofAwareness

Third, the vision of the full extent of awareness is that, without any distinc-
tions concerning the potential of the nature of phenomena-like a face
and irs appearance in a mirror-the nature of awareness is primordially
perfect as three kayas. Throughout all three times, the noble qualities of
the sambhogakaya are perfected as the appearances of the path. It is in this
way that one comes to realize that this is the ultimate meaning of the full
extent of awareness at this juncture in time. Other philosophical tenets
state that, since the essence of the sugatas-the qualities ofkayas and wis-
dom-is obtainable as something that existS, there is expectation. [140]
Their attempts to pursue a goal that leads to individual achievements such
as gaining the major and minor marks with physical features arc predict-
able yet inconspicuous [to them], like a thic£ Conversely, this wisdom
intent of the supreme king of all vehicles is not only inconceivable, it is the
greatest marvel! Those who are incapable of accurately revealing this phi-
losophy will be unable to reveal any genuine meaning, except for meaning-
lessly praising the way appearances arise. The loquacious speech of those
who arc only partially familiar with the scriptures, yet full of intellectual
knowledge about many inauthentic paths, produces the contributing cir-
cumstance of mockery. This occurs through the combination ofboth [141]
blurting and being careless. Therefore, in order to proclaim this secret vehi-
cle in the Snow Land ofTibet, let it be known beyond a trace of doubt this
philosophy is only that of the Sovereign of Conquerors, Drimcd Odzer!

Having said that, the intrinsic nature of the full extent is when the
increasing qualities of awareness gain strength and all appearances become
clear light. Once one is familiar with the nature of the five wisdoms, in
the center of the five formations of the vital essence, the crown protrusion
and half of the deity's head [142] and then the entire solitary kaya arise,
originating from the immaculate purification of the nirmai)akaya. Once
the wisdom of the sambhogakaya reaches itS full extent, all five buddha
families-such as the conqueror ~hobhya-appcar as solitary figures,
then with complete ornamentation, and then with consortS in their fully
perfected aspect. The: principal ones and their retinues arise distinctly in
group formations and arc surrounded by the ma.Qc;{ala's vajra fence and so
forth, originating from the: immaculate purification of the: dharmakaya.
The vision is so perfectly dear that ordinary phenomena are naturally
arrested. Wherever cognition is directed, it is able to penetrate so inani-
mate forms are sc:t into motion and even the body can be seen as parcless
particles. Mountains, crags, and other solid formations [can be: penetrated 1
free: from obstruction. Since the: dualistic mind [1431 has completely col-
lapsed, the: source of any hope and fear is discarded and one becomes like
a rambling idiot. At this time, whatever appears is all-pervasive purity, as
stated in the Blazing Body Relic:

| Whoever becomes familiar with the light will witness objective
| appearances such as the four elements of earth, water, fire, and
| wind naturally vanishing. Gradually, one will unite with the five
| colors, indicating inseparability with light. Furthermore, objec-
| tive appearances will be seen as if by a person gone mad, and
| there will be the ability to travel underground and penetrate,
| without hindrance or obstruction, all mountains and crags.
| Even in water, one will not sink. [144]

So, it is.

All of this reveals the general characteristics of the full extent. To delin-
eate the specific details, it states in the root tantra:

| In the intermediate space between the particles of one's body
| appear windows of light. Delicate light rays emanate from them
| in the form of hooks captivating appearances. The corporeal
| body is naturally arrested, and an unimpeded, stainless light
| body appears marked in the center with a syllable ah. From the
| coil of hair between the eyebrows, light the length of an arm
| span emerges. The crown protrusion appears to be hoisted by
| wind. From the fingers of the peaceful deities light rays gather
| like malas made of beads. This is the soundless activity of the
| mind. [145] From the palace in the cranium all of the wrathful
| deities actually manifest. At this time, one's own body reaches
| the full extent.

Thus, when the body reaches the full extent, appearances without excep-
tion are clearly the pure lands of the five buddhas. From the window of
light in their hearts, radiant light penetrates the ah in one's own heart
through which the great radiant-light empowerment is received. When
light that is an arm span's length from the hair coU is evident, the vital
essence of wisdom wind appears on the crown protrusion in stacks of nine
or five, resembling metal plates. Ultimately, the crown ornament is the
crown aperture.

The meaning of being [146] •hoisted by wind• is that the wisdom wind
enters the space. This indicates a phenomenon unbelievable to behold: the
blazing nature of the major and minor marks. When the wisdom wind
enters the fingers, they appear as five lights; and even the subtle light chan-
nels blaze with the radiance of wisdom so the pores and each and every
particle of one's body are perfected as the pure land of the buddhas-the
essence of the: sambhogakaya. The radiance of the peaceful ma.r;t«ilala of
vajra space and the mat;t«ilala of the wrathful deities in the palace: of the cra-
nium emerges from the: light channc:l in the: aperture of the crown chakra.
Everything in the: upper regions clearly appears as the manifest ma.r;t«ilala of
wrathful deities. Since: this is the lucid arising of sambhogakaya peaceful
and wrathful deities, [147] it is referred to as "the full extent of the body."

SimUarly, when the mind reaches the full extent, the conceptual mind,
mental activity, and consciousness all vanish, leaving only the stainless
space of phenomena. One achieves the six states of clairvoyance such as
the abUity to know the minds of others. One: possesses the eye that sees
the immeasurable pure lands of the victorious onc:s and things at a distance
which are otherwise obstructed by solid matter. The appearances of the
mind are perfectly pure; and, since the mind of emptiness is pure, there is
mastery over the boundless gateways of prajna and samadhi. [148]

In short, through purification of the corporeal body, the channels and
winds are naturally cleansed. Due to that, the temporary gathering of the
constituc:nts61 collapses and the actual coarse connection of the body and
mind is reversed. The subtle dormant aspect, like the Aash of a shooting
star, is when one still holds to the appearances ofboth creation and disso-
lution as stated in the Rroerberation ofSound:

| This severing of the connection between body and mind is the
| exhaustion of the contaminated body, yet the mind's charac-
| teristic of clarity still arises externally. This is clearly observed
| within the element of space like the flash of a shooting star.

Thus, and the quote continues:

| The body becomes pure clear light, and the wind [149] becomes
| like flying sparks. They do not abide anywhere, yet are the nat-
| ural radiance of the ground. This occurs in the manner of two
| aspects of appearances. Then when the connection between
| body and mind is severed, there will be no returning to the three
| realms.

Thus, it is.

Incidentally, here in the Land ofSnow, some philosophers ofother tenets
claim that the appearance of empty form is nothing but confused percep-
tion and that even the four visions of the Great Perfection belong to the
tradition of heretics known as ·viewers of the sun.· Teachers who brazenly
commit the root downfall of harboring aversion to the dharma [through
such claims] belong to the ranks of wolves and cats. [150] Unknowingly
disparaging their own favorite philosophies about the appearance of empty
form, such as found in the Wheel of Timw and others, their limited knowl-
edge is narrow and restricted like a hole. There are others who assert that
to say the state of buddha is without kiyas or wisdoms is a perverted view.
They claim that the [state of buddha] is both an illusory kaya-the ulti-
mate object to accomplish-and genuine truth.

We, on the other hand, understand that the qualities of the essence of
the sugatas are the riipakaya and do not consider this [riipakiya] to be a
confused appearance. Just as the characteristic of the moon is by nature
full, through the vision of the increasing experience, the increase in qual-
ities is the potential of the three kayas perfected as the appearance of the
path. [151] Although appearing in this way, this is merely the reflection of
the radiance of awareness arising externally and is not the essential nature
just as it is. Therefore, we do not fixate upon this as genuine truth. Just as
the moon on the thirtieth day by nature decreases, the key point is that
it is necessary for the essence of externally appearing radiance to become
exhausted. Therefore, we assert that awareness-including the subdc wind
of motion-is pcrfccdy pure and that the appearance of the exhaustion
of the mind and phenomena occurs in the immutable resting place of
the inner space of original purity. That is why a practitioner realizing this
knows that philosophies arc the creation of the intellect and that dispu-
tations arc resolved within the inconceivable nature of phenomena. [I 52·]
When phenomena reach the stage of exhaustion, even one's own philoso-
phy falls apart! At that time, even the upadcsha of the guru vanishes, the
limitations of view, meditation, and conduct arc empty. and there is no
vision of the dharmakaya. Since the continuum of kayas and wisdom has
ceased, there arc no buddhas or sentient beings. In short, nothing what-
soever remains, nothing has gone, and nothing will ever return. Thus, one
must simply rest in the wisdom intent of the Middle Way of nonabiding
in any extreme.

Vision of the Exhaustion of the Naturw of Phenomena

Fourth, the vision of the exhaustion of the nature of phenomena is as
stated in the root tantra:

| The vision of the exhaustion of the nature of phenomena means
| to have emptied the appearances of all other visions and to have
| exhausted the body, as well as the objects of the sense organs.
| Liberated from the confusion of concepts, [153] there is free-
| dom from words as the basis of expression.

Thus, in the scriptures of the Great Yoga on down, from the perspective
of the appearance of method there arc limidcss arrangements of the stages
of generation that must be gathered within the completion stage prajfla of
emptiness.

Similarly, here, in reliance upon the three key points, the motion of the
winds increases as wisdom. By the force of having purified [everything] in
the nature of phenomena, the confused appearances of objective external
elements and the internal confusion of the mind, including the habit of
mental activity, all naturally cease. Even all secret appearances of clear light
dissolve into the nature of phenomena, which is the utterly inexpressible
space of uuth. [154] This is referred to as •exhausted.• Ultimately, it is like
the moon on the thirtieth day, where nothing at all appears even though
the nature of the moon has neither increased nor decreased. The radiance
of awareness dissolves into basic space like the light of a crystal retracted
within.

The nature of exhaustion occurs in two ways. Gradual exhaustion is the
process of the four visions reaching their full extent. In the rare case of
instantaneous realization, at the moment a practitioner of supreme intelli-
gence such as this sees the vision of direct awareness, based on familiarity
and without depending upon the stages of the increasing experience and
the full extent, they arrive at the state of exhaustion.

Whatever the case, it is then that, with the vanishing of the corporeal
body, the enemy of the clements cannot cause harm." [ISS] With the van-
ishing of passions, the clarity of recollection and its basis leave no trace.
With the vanishing of appearances, going, staying, the appearance of the
sun and moon, and so forth all disappear without any remaining impres-
sion. Even the thought that this has occurred no longer exists. This is called
•all appearances of form passing beyond sorrow: At this time, there are two
attainments. Having attained freedom from rebirth, by arising in the kaya
of the great transfcrence,70 one brings to fruition the purpose of beings.
Then, when the stages of the visions arc exhausted, as one focuses on the
gatheringoflight at the fingers, appearances are naturally reversed so that
the support and supported universe and inhabitants [156] arc evident like
the moon's reflection or as in a dream. Even one's own body appears as
though it were a reflection in a mirror, unimpeded and lacking true exis-
tence. What one sees will not be seen by those whose eyes are impure just
as when the king bowed down to the kaya of the great master Padmasam-
bhava, only to touch his own head to the cushion.71

Similarly, by vanishing into particles and becoming dear light, one
attains control over both birth and entrance, which is an exclusive feature
of togal. Through trekcho, the body vanishes into particles and the mind
vanishes into the nature of phenomena so liberation occurs only in the
state of original purity. At that time [through togal], miraculous activities
arc so inconceivable [157] the aims of the six classes ofbeings are fulfilled
both dirccdy and indirectly in their individual realms.71 In particular, the
deed of liberating three thousand human beings with harmonious aspi-
rations •without [physical] remains· is accomplished. Finally, enlighten-
ment in the kaya of the ever-youthful vase of the nature of phenomena will
be achieved, as demonstrated by the living examples Padmasambhava and
the Stainless Teacher ofTruth.(73)

Some of the explanations given by the Omniscient One make reference
to three thousand bardo beings [being liberated]. Since human beings are
in the bardo of the birthplace, there is no contradiction.74

Having mastered entrance, even though at this time there is no great
wave of benefit for others through a kaya, [one can liberate] three thou-
sand beings just by directing awareness. [•s8] Through the key point of
being liberated from the effects of good and bad karma-like mist vanish-
ing in space-dissolving into inner space, the enlightened activity ofinsep-
arable kayas and wisdom is enacted for the: sake of others until sarpsara is
emptied. The radiance of inner luminosity-absorbed without obscura-
tion-becomes the clear, external manifestation of the pure realm of Rich
Array such as the: partial sambhogakaya and so forth arising like a face in a
mirror. From the nature of the unceasing ornamental wheel of enlightened
body, speech, and mind, the five sambhogakaya buddhas appear to the
tenth-ground bodhisatrvas. [159] To shravakas, pratyekas, and ordinary
individuals, the supreme nirmat;lakaya [appears]; and, furthermore, byway
of enacting deeds according to faculties, aspirations, and intentions of sen-
tient beings, the nirm:i!}akaya artisans, reincarnates, and so forth appear.
This is clearly elucidated as well in The Staircase to Altan4htha: which
describes the generation stage.

Supplementary Upadeshas

Fourth, the supplementary upadeshas are as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The four upadc:shas of the concluding support must be given
| after the: preceding [instructions].

Thus, [the four are] holding the ground with the three motionless states,
indicating the extent with the: three: ways of abiding, [160] striking with
the three attainments, and revealing the status of liberation with four states
of confidence:.

Holding the Ground with the Thru Motionless Statts

For the first, it states in the root tantra:

| By one having established the ground with the three motionless
| states, the wind-mind reaches the full potential.

Thus, when one remains motionless in the physical posture, the channels
and winds naturally relax. When one remains motionless with the gaze of
the eyes, the visions increase. When one remains motionless in an uncon-
uived state of mind, space and awareness unite.

Indicating the Extent with the Three Ways ofAbiding

For the second, it states in the root tantra:

| By indicating the extent with the three ways of abiding, dreams
| are reversed and the signs and limits of the body, speech, and
| mind are identified.

Thus, the body abides [161] without engaging in any activity, purifying the
confused thoughts of sarpsara. Winds abiding without increasing termi-
nates the movement of concepts. Visions abiding without shaking allows
the full extent of the pure lands to occur. At that time, there are two: signs
that arise through the three doors and the extent of accomplishment rec-
ognized in the dream state.

For the first, at the time of the direct awareness of the nature ofphenom-
ena, with the maturing of the body through the vase empowerment, the
meaning of effortless action enters the limbs of the body; and, through the
interdependence of the channels relaxing, the body becomes like a tortoise
placed on a metal tray. When the consciousness enters the channc:ls, by
the radiance of the pure basis of expression entering that which indicates
speech, [162] like a mute, one makes no effort to speak. When the meaning
of the natural liberation of the Great Perfection free from fixation enters
the mind, the mind abides wherever it is placed, like a bird in a trap.

At the time of the increasing experience, through the dissolution of the
winds in the central channel, the meaning of freedom from good and bad
permeates the body. One is freed from feeling shame or self-importance like
suffering from a terminal disease. As a result of the purification of speech
through the secret empowerment, the meaning of the Great Perfection-
free from proving and refuting-enters the speech; and, like a crazy per-
son whose utterances arc unintelligible, one speaks without regard for the:
outcome. When the gathering of the concepts of mental activity enter the
mind-like an individual intoxicated seven times by a poisonous hcrb-
[163] the unborn, naturally liberated mind never engages with sarpsaric
activities again.

At the time of the full extent, when the potential of the prajiia empow-
erment penetrates the channels and winds, one's body is unobstructed by
the five elements. This is like how an elephant stuck in the mud is able
to pull itself out through irs own force. When the meaning of the Great
Perfection beyond speech or expression merges with speech, through the
interdependency of compassion overcome with prajiii, speech becomes
like the sweet song of an adolescent kumbhanda.75 Henceforth, whatever is
verbalized is accepted by and benefits others. [164] When the meaning of
one's own originally pure nature-forever primordially liberated-merges
with the stillness of the mind, it is certain that s:upsara will never be reen-
tered,like becoming immune from smallpox.

At the time of the exhaustion of all phenomena, when the Great Perfec-
tion-having transcended the sense organs-purifies the corporeal body,
like a corpse in a cemetery, one will not have the slightest trace of fear even
if a hundred messengers of death arc hovering. When the syllables that
abide in the channels enter the lattice of wisdom wind, the inexpressible
meaning of the king of all vehicles will imbue the sound of speech. The
sound of empty expression will become like an echo, and only the words
of others will be repeated. [165] An individual whose mind has been puri-
fied by the absolute [word] empowerment will, like the consciousness of
someone whose heart has been pierced by an arrow, have the ability to
instandy discern awareness. Departing for the ground of original purity
like vanishing mist, the freedom of the wisdom of perfect buddhahood
will instandy occur.

Incidentally, it is as stated in the Naturally .Arising:

| When exceptional prajiia arises in the mind, recognize it to be
| a deception of the maras. If fearless conduct suddenly bursts
| forth, at that moment recognize which direction prajiia should
| be placed.

Thus, if one is not certain about how to discern the signs of mind-based
experiences, [166] there will be no liberation from maras or the narrow
passageway of obscuring deviations. If the purpose ofthis instruction from
the tantras is synthesized, three signs are taught: the signs that indicate the
obstacles of micas, the: signs of experiences increasing and diminishing,
and the signs of the unchanging secret.

First, some practitioners with dull faculties will grasp at visions and
fixate upon them as real. Verbally proficient yet lacking the depth of
understanding, they will be able to emanate bodies of various colors, in
the mirror of their own shadow a second reflection will appear, they will
be able to understand the minds ofothers, and so forth. When that occurs,
[167] they should cleanse their body by anointing it with frankincense and
nectar from head to toe or by smearing old clay on their limbs so that the
color changes.76 Furthermore, hindrances can take the form of the deity.
Although pure wisdom 4akinis will not enter the world, 4akinis of vari-
ous activities do reveal their forms in the sky and predict that common sid-
dhis will be achieved. The indication of a deviation will be that the mind
changes to become totally different and gives rise to self-defined attach-
ment-fixation, aversion, refuting, and proving. Becoming more and more
opposed to the dharma in this way is [168] referred to as ·oneselfovercome
by the 4akinis." It is as stated in the Naturally .Arising:

| If a prophecy from the 4ikinis is received, since that is to test
| [one's] experience, focus on the view.

Thus, it is as taught. By maintaining equipoise in the meaning of nonexis-
tence, one will be able to overcome the 4alcinis and there will be no poten-
tial to be deceived or lured by enticing, inauthentic siddhis. Furthermore,
in general, meditating upon wrathful deities, reciting wrathful mantras,
melodiously reciting hung, and meditating upon bodhichiua will bring
about reversal.

Second, the signs of increasing and diminishing experiences are as fol-
lows. By the circumstance of the way the winds and mind combine, a sud-
den sense ofunreliable samadhi will develop. (169] In addition, ifuncertain
visions of forms of deities, light formations, and so forth appear in the
sky, perform the following activities. Sometimes soak the body in water,
other times place two pieces of flat wood sixteen finger-widths in length
underneath the chin as a support and massage the body with sandalwood
oil. Partake of cooling foods and recite the essential sound of the unborn
nature-ah. The perfecdy correct path will again be secured.

Third, the. signs of the unchanging secret are as follows. The body
becomes light like cotton, the complexion fair, and white hair and wrinkles
disappear. Hair and nails stop growing, [ 170] and the mudris and syllables
of the five families appear on one's body. The skin becomes youthful, white
hair rums black, and new teeth grow in. One gains the mastery of a flexi-
ble, supple body. Likewise, by the accomplishment of the truth of speech,
whatever is said brings benefit to others. Words that cause confusion are
nc:ver spoken, and many aspects of the dharma are naturally understood.
One comes to know various ancient histories, languages, and dialects of
the beings of the six classes. The speech of the shravakas, pratyekas, and
bodhisattvas can be heard, the movements of the breath are curtailed,
and so forth. (171] Having cleansed the mind, one no longer needs food
and clothing and can remain in samadhi for months or years. The winds
[mind] can be directed at will. By purification of the concepts of the past
and future, stages of activities cease; and, giving rise to immeasurable com-
passion, passions no longer arise in the mindstream. In short, the crucial
point is to remain unsullied by the intellect that encourages refuting and
proving exueme views based on positive or negative hope and fear.

Second, the extent of accomplishment recognized in the dream state is
as follows. It states in the Secret Sound Tantra:•

| For the supreme, (dreams] will cease; for the middling, [dreams]
| will be lucid; and for the inferior, [dreams] will be uans-
| formed.

Thus, for all of those with keen faculties and enthusiasm, the connec-
tion with karma and habits will be severed. [172.] An indication that bud-
dhahood will occur in that very lifetime is when dreams are purified in
the dharmakaya and sleep arises as clear light. For the middling, dreams
become lucid and, through familiarity with dream uansformation, bud-
dhahood will occur in the bardo. For the inferior, the continuum of nega-
tive habits in the dream state is severed and, by experiencing only positive
dreams, rebirth will be taken in the realm of the natural nirmil)akaya.

Striking with the Three Attainments

Third, suiking the nail of the three attainments is as follows. The quote continues:

| By striking the nail of the three attainments, the contaminated body vanishes.

Thus, if words that convey the same meaning are not continually repeated,
that meaning may not be fully understood. Once mastery over outer
appearances is gained, circumstantial phenomena arise as pure lands. [173]
Internally, once mastery over the magical body is gained, the corporeal
body is purified in clear light. Secretly, once: mastery over the wind-mind
is gained, even a consciousness that has committed the five: heinous non-
virtues can be guided by focusing awareness.

Revealing the Status of Libtration with the Four States of Confidence

Fourth, the: four states of confidence are as stated in the Heap of Precious jewels:

| With the unchanging view of the four states of great confidence:,
| the full extent of irreversible wisdom will be: recognized.

Thus, even though one hears of the suffering of the three: lower realms,
the finitude of life span and so forth, one determines that it is impossible
for bliss and suffering to independently exist in one's own nature which
has never been confused from beginningless time. The: confidence: of not
fearing the lower realms is aroused; and, when awareness arrives upon the
ground, even the: name: "sarpsara• no longer exists. [ 17 4] This is why there
will be the: confidence: of no longer anticipating the ripening of cause and
result. In this way, through liberation in the innate nature: of phenomena,
the thought "this is happiness· no longer occurs. Since there: is no inde-
pendent state beyond sorrow, there: will be: the: confidence of not hoping
for anything to be obtained. Even though hearing about the immeasurable
qualities of the: victorious ones, except for encountering one's own true:
nature, one will know that there is not even a hair tip's worth of something
else that becomes buddha. By encountering this very nature, there: will be
confidence that joy and sorrow arc: pure in the nature of evenness.
Once one has perfected these: four states of confidence:, the instructions
for entering the citadel of enlightenment arc: as follows. It states in Vajra·
sattva s Mirror of the Heart Tantra:

| There are two states of enlightenment: [175) the state of fully
| perfected buddhahood• and the state of fully manifest bud-
| dhahood.h Fully perfected buddhahood means to achieve
| enlightenment without any trace of the corporeal body remain-
| ing; whereas, when the state of fully manifest buddhahood is
| attained, various signs having to do with light, sound, physical
| remains, kayas, the motion of the earth, and so forth will occur.

Thus, concerning the first, this includes the great Chetsun• and all those
who preceded him who were famous for their actual accomplishment.
The latter case includes the Sovereign of the Victorious Ones-Drimed
Odzer-who, in the great charnel ground forest of Chimpu, manifested
among the two lights, circular; of the two sounds, loud roaring; and of
the twokayas, wrathful. [176) He manifested both the sacred remains and
relics that cannot be destroyed by the elements, while a great earthquake
thundered, roared, shook, trembled, hammered, and pounded with great
force. These six signs were repeated seven times as he revealed the state
of fully manifest buddhahood. Without a single sign left incomplete, he
departed for the ground of original purity.

FOR THOSE OF MIDDLING FACULTY

The second section, for those of middling faculty, is a precise explanation
of the instructions on liberation in the bardo as stated in the Revn-bn-a-
tion ofSound:

| If defined by categories, there are four.

Thus, the natural bardo,• the moment ofdeath,• the nature of phenomena/
and existence' arc the four decisive boundaries that delineate the bardos.

THE NATURAL BARDO

First, the natural bardo is as follows. The general condition of sentient
beings [177] is such that the habit of previous passions is impressed upon
the basis of all, becoming the seed that creates future habits. By the power
of individual karma, there is a force that propels beings to take rebirth in
various environments and classes and states of happiness, suffering, and
indifference. That which is called "potential" means that, through the single
cause of ignorance, the distinctions of duality arc created and, based on the
aspects of the corresponding results, the beings of the six classes appear.

Concerning this, a single substance is perceived differently by each sen-
tient being through the power of their individual karma. For instance, the
substance water is perceived by gods as nectar, humans as water, animals
as a drink to quench thirst, deprived spirits as pus and blood, and by hell
beings [178] as molten lava. Although perceived in those ways, [water] has
no true, inherent existence. In The Bodhisattva's Way of Lift it states:

| Who has created the ground of the earth as an iron-hot inferno?
| Where does this fire arise from? The Buddha taught that this
| and everything like it is the result of the negative mind.

So, it is as taught.

In this way, the moment that the arrangement of appearances consti-
tuting the three realms dawns, that is entrance into the natural bardo. For
those of us who are human beings, the five aggregates obscure the appear-
ance of five kayas. The elements and sense organs obscure the luster of clear
light. Karma and passions obscure the appearance of the nature ofphenom-
ena. Consequently, there come to be the present independent [179] expe-
riences of happiness and sorrow. Knowing that this leads only to faulted
states of future rebirth, the method to reverse it is determined by under-
standing the way of the natural bardo in order to sever the cord of doubt.
For example, among birds, the finch is extremely clever since before build-
ing a nest it carefully checks to see if there is any danger or threat &om
humans. Once the nest is determined safe, whenever [the finch] enters
the nest, there is no hesitation. Similarly, at this moment of the narrow
passageway, the unsurpassable, indispensable guide is called •the lamp

of hearing that dispc:ls the: darkness of ignorance:." Holding the: meaning
of this in mind, [180] it is important to sever all doubts with certainty
derived from hearing and contemplating.

Nevertheless, since in the present time most beings are tormented by
various degrees of discouragement and degeneracy, it is as stated in the:
[Treasury ofthe] Predous Genuine Meaning:

| During the: Age: of Excc:llc:ncc:, even all gurus were only maha-
| siddhas. Based on the individual's karma and the: guru's com-
| passion and omniscience:, liberation would occur solc:ly through
| the: potency of dharma according to personal karmic connec-
| tions and aspirations. Conversc:ly, nowadays, it is difficult to
| be endowed with such forrunatc: karma. With countless con-
| cepts proliferating, it is almost impossible: to cut through even
| a single: thought. That is why it is essential for all ordinary indi-
| viduals [181] to thoroughly train through hearing and contem-
| plating. Once: one: arrives at the: time: of the: conclusion of this
| heart-essence doctrine:, practice: is then referred to as •devotion-
| based." Given that this king of secrets is the: pinnacle: of all doc-
| trines, except for those: who arc: capable: of great hearing and
| contemplating and whose: wisdom and fortune: arc: supreme:, it
| is impossible: for this meaning to be: realized. Thc:rc:forc:, to enter
| this vehicle: it is necessary to largc:ly depend upon the: cultivation
| of hearing and contemplating.

Thus, and the: quote: continues:

| In particular, the: guru must know the: unmistakc:n path, for if
| not, whatever is taught will be: mistaken. There: fore:, vast hearing
| and contemplation must be: devdopc:d first

Thus, these are my heartfelt words of advice for the beings of the five-hundred-year
period [of degeneration]. [182]

THE BARDO OF THE MOMENT OF DEATH

Second, the: bardo of the: moment of death is as follows. In the: Conjunction
ofthe Sun and Moon it states:

| Life is impermanent, like a traveler on a journey who never stays in one place.

Thus, once there is birth, death is naturally looming. In the Conjunction
ofthe Sun and Moon and all upadesha literature there are extensive expla-
nations on how the signs of death occur and how to deceive death. By
understanding this, one can reverse sudden obstacles. Otherwise, it is as
the quote states:

| There is no direction on this earth where anyone has ever been
| spared the arm of death itself.

Thus, as taught, according to the teachings given in the Sutra ofAdvice
to the King, • the actual boundary defining the time of death [183] begins
when the illness causing the circumstance of death strikes until the inner
breath stops. During that period of time, it is crucial to know the oral
advice so that whatever is vague becomes as vivid as a damsel's image of
herself in a mirror.

In the Conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon it states,

| This is the time that all upadeshas from the guru must merge with the disciple's stream of mind.

Thus, if the dying individual is a Great Perfection practitioner-like a care-
free child not keeping track of details-he or she will be unconcerned with
the signs, place, or time of death. If that is the case, these instructions will
not be necessary.

The best of middling capacity will be indifferent to the circumstances
or place, whether death occurs on a road or an intersection in a city. This is
how a homeless vagrant would die. [184] An average practitioner's death
would be beyond concern for external circumstances, like a wild animal
such as a lion who dies in the mountains, in a cave, or in an empty val-
ley. Engaging with the kayas and wisdom, this is referred to as "entering
the innate clear light" or •entering the pure realms through powab instruc-
tions: In both cases [of entering] success depends upon the power of
familiarity. The visualization for the first is as stated in the Conjunction of
tbe Sun and Moon:

| The way to engage the union of kayas and wisdom is to direct
| awareness as follows. With the body in the sleeping-lion pos-
| ture, direct awareness to the eyes. Allow the gaze to rest momen-
| tarily in space. Ifspace and awareness [185] are stable, the person
| will have no bardo and buddhahood will surely be achieved.

Thus, assuming [one of] the three postures or remaining in the sleeping-
lion posture, focus awareness on the eyes. With eyes directed to the space
of awareness, relinquish the present life and relax uncontrived within orig-
inal purity. In an instant liberation will occur. This is also called •introduc-
ing the secret path.•

Since this is an extremely profound key point, even while one is alive,
when the sky is pristine, direct awareness into space and think, •The
moment of death has arrived. Now I must pass into the peaceful unelab-
orate expanse." [186] Exhale the breath and follow that by allowing the
mind to remain without focus. This path is extremely swift!

For the latter, it states in the tantras:

| The way of entering into various realms is as follows. The teach-
| ings for reanimating the dead and transferring consciousness are
| practiced by the consciousness mounting the winds. For that, it
| is important to have previous experience through training. It
| is also important to concentrate and transfer awareness. Then,
| with bile, [the consciousness] is ejected. This depends upon the
| guru's oral instructions.

Thus, during the final moments of the last breath, awareness as a white ab
in the heart is ejected direcdy up through the crown aperture. By reciting
bile twenty-one times, liberation will occur. [187] Just as mentioned in the
tantras, it is important to train while still alive! Those endowed with this
key point need not depend upon the stages of dissolution. Through the
bodhisattva's manner of transferring breath, they will pass beyond sorrow.

At this time, if clarification through verbal elaboration is necessary, it is
best to receive this from one's guru. If that is not possible, a vajra relative
with undefiled samaya should recite as follows:

| O fortunate child! This clear light is actual wisdom that origi-
| nates from itsd£ Let your mind remain in this nature without
| contrivance, and you will unimpededly arrive [ 188] in the state of
| buddhahood. If through this the mind is still unable to do away
| with concepts, eject awareness as a white ah out of the crown
| aperture like a flung arrow. In the upper direction is the realm
| of perfectly pure space. It is there that the conqueror known as
| King of Space dwells. Endowed with the empowerment of the
| ground-the fundamental nature of the Great Perfection-for-
| tunate one, fearlessly receive it! Depart for the appearance of the
| ground of the nature of phenomena and you will achieve bud-
| dhahood in the ground of original purity. If by chance libera-
| tion does not occur, recognize all appearances of the bardo of
| the nature of phenomena to be your own. [189] At the moment
| you recognize your own nature, joyfully depart for the space of
| original purity.

Thus, having repeated this three times, [the instructor] should also remain
in equipoise.

These instructions are exceptionally sublime because they are drawn
from the Naturally Occurring Grtat Pnftction• and other texts. Here,
despite having received upadesha, if one does not have full confidence, as
with all ordinary individuals, retraction of the channels and winds begins
with the four outer elements, with the five inner aspects of space, and with
the five secret life forces. All additional twenty winds will dissolve accord-
ing to the subtle stages of decomposition. Although this is explained in
detail in the tantra Naturally .Arising. that which is presented here is so
that ordinary individuals can easily understand. [190] The way the de-
ments dissolve and the winds depart is stated in the Conjunction oftht Sun
and Moon:

| When the earth dement dissolves back into earth, the body
| becomes heavy, unable to rise. The ability to stand and move
| diminishes. When the water dement dissolves back into water,
| fluids issue from the mouth and nostrils. Similarly, when the fire
| clement dissolves back into fire, the mouth and nose completely
| dry up. The body loses heat from the extremities inward. Like-
| wise, when the wind dement dissolves back into wind, breath
| becomes erratic, the limbs struggle, and the eyes roll back in the
| head. Whoever experiences these signs is departing from this
| world.

Thus, and in the Clear Expanse it states:

| When the wind that mobilizes the body departs, [191] the body
| can no longer raise itself up and the hamstrings tremble. The
| limbs will not contract, and speech becomes difficult. The eyes
| roll back, and the breath is exhaled. When the wind that gives
| the physical complexion luster departs, the entire body-as well
| as the area around the mouth and nose-becomes a gray color,
| like smoke. Pain shoots through the muscles, and a foul stench
| issues from the mouth and nose. When the wind that separates
| impure substances from pure departs the body, one can no lon-
| ger eat or drink and the strength of the body diminishes. When
| the wind that distributes heat throughout the body departs, the
| warmth of the body escapes from the extremities. The splendor
| and luster ofthe body fades. When the wind of the karma of the
| con escapes, the body trembles uncontrollably and the blood in
| the veins and capillaries retracts into the aorta.

Thus, and the quote continues:

| At that time, [192] appearances dissolve as follows. All outer
| sensory perceptions and recollections dissolve, so that every-
| thing becomes like the darkness of night. Awareness dissolves
| into the center of the heart, memory fades, and speech no lon-
| ger functions.

Thus, at this point, the so-called mind is the radiance of awareness carried
by the wind-mind in the lungs, like a blind horse. When this combination
[wind-mind] separates and the radiance of awareness dissolves into aware-
ness in the heart, it is like a crippled man. All winds without exception pass
through the path of the windpipe to flow out the mouth and nose. When
[the wind] can no longer return, this is called the "separation of mind and
wisdom" or the time of death.

At that time, it is beneficial to rely upon the three precious upadcshas of
the great, profound tantra Conjunction of the Sun and Moon: [193]

| Joining one's mouth and nostrils with the person's whose rec-
| ollection has diminished," forcefully exhale three long breaths
| of air. With the first breath, imagine a white om; with the sec-
| ond, a red ah; and, with the third, exhale and abide in emptiness.
| With each inhalation imagine that the individual's conscious-
| ness returns to their body as a blue hung and in the same instant
| recite hung with such force that the intestines retract to touch
| the spine. The eyes of the individual should then fly open. At
| that time, introduce the luminosity of the empty vital essence
| [194] called pointing-out instructions: ·o fonunatc one, this
| is the clear light of your own nature. At this time of separation
| from your body, the three doors arc no longer an obstruction so,
| although the bardo of the nature of phenomena-including all
| the sounds and lights-arises in all its glory, it is not other than
| your own appearances. You must recognize this! Since this pres-
| ent naked awareness is actual liberation itself. do not deviate!
| Do you sec the appearances? Do you hear these instructions?"

| Thus, if there is a response or a sign becomes apparent, the
| transmission was successful. If there are indications that the
| [individual's] consciousness is clear [19s] or the sense organs
| are vaguely alert, shape paper into a cone or usc a piece of bam-
| boo and place your mouth at one end while inserting the other
| into the individual's car, saying, "0 fonunate child! Don't be
| attached to anything! You have separated from your corporeal
| body of flesh and blood. It is poindcss to be afraid of the bardo
| of the nature of phenomena's radiant light and sound! Recog-
| nize that your own appearances do not actually exist and seize
| the immutable resting place. If you arc unable to abide there,
| bring to mind the pure realm of Great Bliss.• Generate devotion
| and depart! Have no doubt that you will meet with the Buddha
| of Boundless Lighr: 71 Thus, melodiously recite. It is excellent
| if this is recited when the [196] stages of dissolution begin.
| This is an exceptional key point known as •the consummate
| introduction.'"

Furthermore, it states in the Conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon:

| If the dying individual is still breathing, there is no doubt that
| [the individual] will be led from that state by the syllables,
| breath, and so forth.

Thus, most ordinary beings who have never heard this dharma before will
indicate their future place of rebirth through body language and other
signs.

The method to lead them to higher states from the time the death pro-
cess begins until the consciousness departS is as follows. Visualize a white
ah in the individual's heart. Place your mouth close to their crown aper-
ture. [197] As they exhale, slowly and melodiously recite ah as many times
as the ag~ of the dying person. When it is apparent that the person's last
breath has expired, at that very moment recite ah twenty-one times. If
steam emits [from the crown], even though the individual may have com-
mitted many nonvirtues, they will be led to a higher realm. Those already
destined for a higher rebirth will be able to be led to an even higher state.
If by chance an individual displays the signs of a hell-realm rebirth-in
order to prevent their direct descent-at the moment the person sepa-
rates from their breath, visualize the consciousness in their hean as ah and,
while reciting ah, simultaneously imagine that this melts into 6ve lights.
Mingle [198] this with your mind and rest. Ifthe guide possesses high real-
ization, because the consciousness of the deceased is by nature clear light,
this will unite with the truth of the nature of phenomena. As an excep-
tional key point for guiding the consciousness, this is a sublime: feature of
the: king of vehicles.

Like the example of a king on his horse struck by a cannonball 6rc:d by
the minister, all the blood in the body condenses into the aona as pools of
blood surge into [the aorta] in three stages. The length of the breath is also
different [at each stage] during the three exhalations. Finally, when the
outer breath ceases, and the winds dissolve into the consciousness, [199]
awareness momentarily falls unconscious in the: center of the heart. It is
during that state of unconsciousness that the inner breath ceases, as stated
in the Cltar Expanst:

| As the blood in the body condenses, when the [first] pool of
| blood strikes the aorta, both the mouth and eyes become pale.
| Breath is exhaled the length of a cubit. When the second pool
| of blood strikes, the head falls forward and breath is flung the
| distance of an arrow. When the third surge ofblood strikes, with
| the sound ofilt the breath shoots out the length of an arm span.
| Then the outer breath ceases, awareness falls unconscious in the
| heart, and, when the inner breath ceases, that is when the bardo
| of the nature of phenomena dawns. [200]

So, it is taught.

THE BARDO OF THE NATURE OF PHENOMENA

Third, the bardo of the nature of phenomena is as follows. Once the sup-
port of self-fixation-the heap of aggregates-has been discarded, the
dear-light manifestation of one's own innate nature appears. At that time,
it is necessary to possess the oral instructions in order to trust one's own
appearances like a child joining his mother's lap. This analogy reflects the
profound connection between mother and child. Not only that, just after
birth even animals are capable of knowing their mother among many
through their karmic connection, singling her out to suckle without hesi-
tation. The practice of trekcho imbues realization of the ground of aware-
ness as the great nature of original purity abiding like the mother. From
that, phenomena that arise from the appearance of the ground are like the
child. Becoming familiar with that through togal, [101] like a child recog-
nizing his mother and joining her, in the bardo one recognizes that both
the nature and its own strength are like the sun and its own rays. Gaining
certainty that this is not other than one's own appearances, at the moment
of discernment buddhahood occurs without a bardo, like a child uniting
with his mother.

Moreover, [the methods] on this exceptional secret path are as follows.
When all stages ofdissolution of the restricted corporeal body are complete

and the connection between body and mind has ended, the consciousness
of the basis of all-devoid of memory and thought processes-although
said to dissolve into space actually dissolves into the basic space of phe-
nomena. In that instant, the natural clear light dawns like a cloudless
autumn sky. [202] With no boundaries whatsoever, having not fallen to
any extreme, empty clarity arises free from the veil of obscurity. Recognize
and rest in this very nature, without contrivance. This is referred to as the
•ground of the great original state of liberation." The distinction of the six
special features sets this apart from the ground of confusion so liberation
is immediate in the great inner space of original purity.

Concerning this, it states in the Omniscient One's Ouan of Profound
Meaning that the place where liberation occurs when space dissolves
into clear light is called me first instant: This phrase presents the con-
nection with what follows [the second and third instants]. Nevertheless,
the complete upadeshas that represent a conclusive analysis [203] through
oral instructions can be understood in the Lamp That Illuminates the Key
Points of Practice, and other texts. In addition, the concise and extensive
explanations, as well as those given on the obscured and hidden meaning
presented through the six limitations and the four modes,10 are not easily
comprehended. Although I am inclined to shoot the arrow of scriptural
reference and reasoning concerning all of this, given that this is an upade-
sha text and the main emphasis is on the meaning, I have taken care not to
use an abundance of words.

If liberation docs not occur at that time, that which is referred to as the
dissolution of space into clear light" occurs. It states in the Conjunction of
the Sun and Moon:

| This is referred to as an ordinary individual's consciousness
| [204] dissolving into clear light: At the moment the continuum
| of breathing ceases, except for the aspect of one's own organs,
| substantial appearances have ceased yet the thought that they
| arc there still occurs. When the corporeal body is no longer vis-
| ible, the body of light becomes evident. Then the entire field of
| experience appears as the mandala of five-colored light rays.

Thus, although time does not change, appearances do change, so the exter
nal earth, stones, mountains, cliffs, forests, the sun, moon, and so forth
the entire support of the universe and inhabitants-will fade. Wherever 
one looks, it will seem as though a bolt ofbrocade silk was unfurling or as 
though covered by a thin piece of muslin while looking at the rays of the 
sun. All appearances [:z.os] will be extremely bright and colorful, devoid of 
distinctions such as outer, inner, wide, or narrow. Everything will seem as 
though buoyant and shimmering with a dazzling radiance. At that time, to 
the extent that one is familiar with toga! practice, these appearances will be 
supportive aspects of awareness enduring for extended periods of time. For 
those who are unfamiliar, they will disappear as swiftly as a shooting star. 

The manner in which awareness sustains its own place is as stated in the 
root tantra: 

| At that time, when the appearance of light is spherical, those 
| who arc knowledgeable will sustain the arising of the visions. 

Thus, as the visions arise, those with naturally relaxed concentration will 
recognize them to be their own. In the first instant, [:z.o6] one will have the 
confidence ofknowing one's appearances lack true existence. In the second 
instant, they will be liberated in their own place. In the third instant, the 
immutable state of liberation will be secured. From that moment onward, 
there will be no visions at all. 

Then, clear light dissolving into nonduality is as stated in the Conjunc
tion of the Sun and Moon: 

| Then, for ordinary individuals, that which is referred to as • clear 
| light dissolving into nonduality• is as follows. All appearances 
| arise only in the form of kiyas. The: kiyas are not too large or 
| small, arc the same proportion, arc: adorned with ornaments, 
| and have their own colors, postures, thrones, and mudras. 

Thus, when the visions arise in the form of wrathful deities, those kayas 
within the palace of the cranium, although no larger than mustard seeds, 
[207] will seem so colossal in the: bardo that it will be as though they encom
pass the universe:. Conversely, they will also appear as minute as mustard 
seeds while: remaining perfccdy proportioned. In all cases, the way that 
their heads and mannerisms appear will be unpredictable. Brandishing
various magical weapons, they will be striking out, causing panic and fear. 
Their roar will be so loud and terrifying that it will resemble the unceasing 
sound of a thousand dragons. Their radiance will imbue fear like penetrat
ing weapons. It states in the Clear Expanse: 

| At that time, sounds and lights will gather, and the appearance 
| ofkayas will be utterly terrifying. 

Here, as if this were a stuffed lion, it is necessary to be fearless and gain con
fidence not to react to one's own appearances. [208] 
The way in which even all ordinary individuals who are excellent 
practitioners could still revert back [to SaJJlsara] is as stated in the Upatk
sha of the Essential Wisdom Intent:• 

| Alas, holder of the secret! If the nature is not recognized now, 
| buddhahood will not be attained no matter how much medita
| tion has been practiced. Having not encountered the key upade
| sha, the lights will produce fear, the sounds will bring panic, 
| and the glare will bring terror. If you do not encounter the key 
| point of the instructions, you will faU to recognize the sounds, 
| lights, and glare-these three-so you will once again wander 
| in existence. 

So, it is. 

All the tantras of the Great Yoga reveal-to a certain degree-the illu
sory body in the bardo arising as the sambhogakaya; but because they are 
not the tantras of upadesha, [ 2.09] the actual aspect of the appearances 
of natural spontaneous presence is concealed. This is more sublime than 
holding to independent appearances and never knowing that enlighten
ment occurs in the space of one's own appearances as the sambhogakaya. 
It is as taught in the Sixfoltl Expanse: 

| The bardo of the pure nature of phenomena and the magical 
| body of the meditation deity are so simUar that they can be 
| mistaken. 

Thus, it is. 

Likewise, the peaceful appearances arc as follows. In the Conjunction [of 
the Sun and Moon] it states: 

| Even all the kayas appear in a group formation of five, each with 
| consort, and each group formation of five is surrounded by rings 
| of light. All the maQ4alas of the families of the male, the fami
| lies of the female, and the male and female sattvas [ 11 o] abide 
| as one. 

Thus, these visions of the group formations of the male/female five fam
ilies gradually develop. The way they arise according to stages for the 
duration of the five days of samadhi-likc shoots from a seedling-is as 
follows. 

On the first day, Vairochana with consort and assembly appear as the 
principal family surrounded by a group formation of five. On the second 
day, Vajra Ak~hobhya appears. On the third day, Ratnasambhava; on the 
fourth day, Amitibha; and on the fifth day, Amoghasiddhi appears as the 
principal in group formation. Reference to •a day of samadhi" corresponds 
to the duration of time that the deceased was able to remain in samadhi. 
[211] Here, liberation occurs through the three key points as quoted before 
[from Conjunction of the Sun and Moon]: 

| At this time, a very subde shafi: of light will emerge from one's 
| heart and connect to the hearts of all the buddhas. If one can 
| ascertain that, one will naturally abide in nonconccptual con
| centration. This is referred to as ·awareness engaging with light: 
| When all these appearances manifest and completely intermin
| gle, coundess subdc vital essences will emerge from the shaft 
| of light in the heart. Then, from one's heart a twisted, multi
| colored filament of light will issue forth. As appearances arise, 
| one will think that all kayas arc dissolving into one's body. [212] 
| This is referred to as "light engaging back into awareness." At 
| that time, all individuals with confidence in their own appear
| ances must recall the supreme method, like a child joining its 
| mother's lap. 

If stability in this is not achieved, then it is referred to as ·nondualiry 
dissolving into wisdom: Although I will not be elucidating the vision of 
the union of the four aspects of wisdom-the inner path ofVajrasarrva
this can be understood in the quote from the Conjunction of the Sun and 
Moon, where it states: 

| Once again, from one's heart a very subtle filament of light will 
| emerge. This will appear to be projected upward into space. If 
| one looks at this without allowing the eyes to become distracted, 
| [213] then it will seem enormous and unmingled with any other 
| appearances. Then, upon a blanket of blue light, radiant vital 
| essences will appear like overturned mirrors.11 Appearing like 
| a sapphire cup turned over, endowed with the inner radiance 
| of wisdom, this is exceedingly bright and dazzling and natu
| rally adorned with vital essences of five, each adorned with five. 
| Above this, upon a blanket of white light similar to an over
| turned cup, appear extremely radiant vital essences arising as 
| before, including the inner radiance of wisdom. Then, above 
| this, upon a blanket of golden light like an overturned golden 
| cup, [214] everything arises just as before. Above that, upon a 
| blanket of red light like an overturned ruby cup, the appearances 
| will arise just like the preceding ones. Above that will appear an 
| extremely clear orb of light like the fan of a peacock. Although 
| this is the appearance of the five aspects of wisdom, the manifes
| tation of the wisdom of all-accomplishing activity has not been 
| perfected, so it will not be apparent. This is called the "vision 
| of the union of the four aspects of wisdom • and is also referred 
| to as the ·inner path ofVajrasatrva: It is here where one must 
| recall the supreme method, like that which employs the unwav
| ering golden needle.

Thus, just as it is taught-in the face of each appearance-by resting in the 
unwavering equipoise offresh and present awareness, [215] it is analogous 
to how a skillful physician drains fluid surrounding a patient's heart. Dur
ing the insertion of the golden needle, the key point is to ensure that the 
needle will not waver even a fraction of a hair so that the fluid can be eas
ily drained from the heart. 

Similarly, here, liberation occurs when awareness never wavers from 
its own place. At this point, the statement "since the noble qualities of 
basic space have not been brought to completion, their full potential is not 
yet perfected" must be understood as referring to the "union of the: four 
aspects of wisdom: As the Omniscient One states: 

| Here, when liberation in the state: of original purity has still not 
| occurred, it is posited as the "union of the: four aspects of wis
| dom: The: assc:nion of those: with inferior intelligence that the 
| wisdom of all-accomplishing activity does not exist is utterly 
| unacceptable! 

So, as taught, when the actual result is perfected, [216] that is the appear
ance of all five wisdoms. This is why it is necessary to know the depth and 
breadth of the tantra's wisdom intent. 

Then, what is referred to as "wisdom dissolving into spontaneous pres
ence" occurs as follows. From the thought that all previous visions and 
awareness dissolve into the upper orb of light, original purity arises above 
like stainless space. Below this, the wrathful maQ4ala of the: sambhogakaya 
is extremely vast and rich; below that, the peaceful sambhogakaya maQQala 
of radiant light and in the surrounding regions the natural nirm~akaya 
pure realms are all perfectly arranged. Further below those, the confused 
appearances of six classes [217] of beings, including the six sages as their 
tamers, appear. One's own appearances arise as a reflection, referred to as 
"the appearance of the: ground that never wavers from the ground: The: 
eight ways that these appearances arise are as follows. 

By [appearances] arising as compassion, with the force of the energy of 
compassion that engages in sarpsara, there is no differentiation between 
sarpsara and enlightenment. By [appearances] arising as light, the aspect 
of appearance is radiant within. By arising as kayas, appearances are com
pletely undivided. By arising as wisdom, they are unimpeded. By arising as 
indivisible, awareness abides single-pointedly. By arising free of boundar
ies, appearances are cleansed within the nature as it is. By arising impurely, 
the origin of existence remains unceasing. By [appearances] arising purdy, 
the primordial mother and child unite. [218] 

At this time, as if reuniting with an old acquaintance, there is confidence 
free from doubt that the appearances are one's own. As in the analogy of 
the unhesitating thrust of the golden needle, remain confident without 
distraction and seize the immutable resting place. As in the example of
the irreversible thrust of a flung arrow, seize the immutable ground and 
liberation will occur by unwaveringly resting in the innate nature. 
Although this reveals the eight modes of arising, they are unsullied by 
the mind that disengages from saipsara and engages in enlightenment. 
Nevertheless, the way of revealing the faults associated with what seems to 
be a connection [between the eight modes and the mind] is similar to the 
way a single consciousness seems to engage the six organs individually. The 
meaning is understood through that example. 

In the Heap of Precious Jewels tantra [219] it is clearly revealed that the 
nature is in accord with great space: however, those who are deluded about 
the profound meaning of this crucial point explain in many ways that the 
visions of precious spontaneous presence are eight independent objective 
appearances. These are all mistaken. For that reason, in the Prtcious Gtn
uint Mtaning it states that •from this, even I [Longchenpa himself] have 
discovered certainty about the key points of the heart essence: Think
ing over these genuine explanations, I am extremely pleased to express the 
great joy I feel in knowing that the doctrine of the Great Perfection still 
endures even now in this world, much like the setting sun. 
Moreover, it states in the Clear Expanse: [220]

| At this time, fortunate child, nine states of clairvoyance will arise. 

Thus, as stated, if one thinks carefully, one will understand that [the states 
of clairvoyance 1 are not other than the magnificent potential or energy of 
the great visions of spontaneous presence. 
Generally, here, the way of internalizing the five states of clairvoyance 
and the stages of pure recollection is according to the wisdom intent of the 
great commentary called the Prtcious Goldtn Rosary. Based on that, pure 
recollection initially occurs as stated in the Sun and Moon: 

| By recalling the meditation deity, at that moment one will see 
| the face of the deity. By recalling all the paths, one will achieve 
| mastery in the bardo of the nature of phenomena. By recall
| ing the place of rebirth, [ 1111 all those of inferior faculties will 
| breathe the breath of rebirth in the natural nirmil].akaya pure 
| realrns.13 By recalling all states of meditative concentration, 
| one will abide for five days in concentration. By recalling the
| tcachcr·s upadcsha. onc·s phenomena will be indivisible. By 
| recalling the view. this will be like recognizing an old acquain
| tance from the past. 

Thus, as stated, by recalling the wisdom deity, at that moment a vision of 
the deity will occur. All those with yearning devotion for a supreme guru 
will, at the moment of recalling the guru with fervent regard. see the guru 
arriving in the space before them to reveal upadcsha instructions. [222] In 
order to be liberated from the city of the bardo through the force of recall
ing the teachings. it is crucial to become familiar in the immediate present. 
It is simUarly stated in the Clear Expanse: 

| There are six nates of clairvoyance. each with six. 

Thus this quote refers to functionality with the faculties and mind. mas
tery of prajna. pure perception of wisdom. unerringly seeing the nature 
of phenomena. and unerringly seeing as a buddha. Each of these six has 
six degrees of purity: pure. extremely pure. exceptionally pure. supremely 
pure. [223] and so forth. These categories. which total thirty-six, arc to be 
understood according to the teachings of the supreme vehicle. 

It states in the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon: 

| The six states of clairvoyance wUl arise for those who arc fortu
| nate ones. They wUl become aware of the immediate past life
| time. where death occurred, and where the next place of rebirth 
| will be. They will acquire the abUity to know what is in the 
| minds of others, to understand all mysterious appearances. and 
| to see the six realms of sarpsara. These six states of clairvoyance 
| will arise with all faculties perfectly pure. 

Thus. this synthesizes the meaning. 

Similarly. all spiritual uansmissions received in the past will simultane
ously come to mind, [2.2.4] and even dharma instructions that were never 
heard before will arise without limitation within the mind. This is the 
power of total recall. The quote continues: 

| At that time. even the power of total recall arises in the mind and 
| all previously received dharma transmissions simultaneously 
| dawn. Likewise, even dharma that has never been received 
| comes to mind. Therefore, this is referred to as the ·bardo of the 
| nature of phenomena.• 

Thus, the continuity of the mind is purified in the inconceivable nature 
of phenomena, so the manner in which one peacefully abides in samadhi 
is as stated in the Conjunction [ofth~ Sun and Moon]: 
When the continuity of samadhi naturally arises within the 
stream of mind, negative thoughts arc permanently put to rest. [225]

Thus, at this juncture, the signs of liberation occurring in the bardo are 
uncertain due to the degrees of the faculties. 

According to the Perfected Skill of the Lion, it takes five days; according 
to the Blazing Body Relic, it is but five scconds. In the Conjunction of the
Sun and Moon it states: 

| Therefore, according to faculties, there are three levels. The supe
| rior are liberated in three seconds, the middling achieve stabi
| lization afi:er five days, and it is certain that the inferior achieve 
| stabilization afi:er twenty-one seconds. 

In addition, the Naturally Arising states: 

| According to individual capacities, after twenty-one days ... 

Although these explanations are given, here those who fail to discern a 
·second" and a ·day- of samadhi, counting them as the same, [226] will 
be wounded by the claws of the scriptural intelligence of the Sovereign of 
Speech [Longchenpa]. Based on that, when awareness of an appearance 
occurs, the time it takes to think that this is an objective perception is a sec
ond of complete freedom. A ·second" of a completed action is even longer 
than that. For example, it is like the difference between the sense organs 
ascertaining an object, knowing the characteristic [of the object], and the 
completion of the process. 

Regardless, when the previously arising visions of spontaneous presence 
dissolve within, the manner in which the eight modes of dissolution occur
simultaneously is as stated in the Naturally Arising: 

| Compassion dissolving into compassion resembles the rays of 
| the setting sun. [227] 

Thus, because the appearances of the six realms no longer exist in this 
nature, the name ·confusion" is nonexistent. 

| Wisdom dissolving into wisdom is like a child joining his mother's lap. 

Thus, wisdom is not other than the mingling of the mother and child 
nature of phenomena. 

| Light dissolving into light is Jike a rainbow vanishing in the sky. 
| Kayas dissolving into kayas arc like the: vase embodiment!5 

Thus, the meaning is that wisdom is inwardly radiant without establishing 
specific characteristics such as heads and arms. 

| Nonduality dissolving into nondualicy is Jike a river merging 
| into a river. Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom 
| from extremes is like [2.2.8] space dissolving in space:. 

Thus, by the mingling of the object dissolving and the dissolution-with 
emptiness as the objc:cdess focus-this is the manner in which one abides 
in the wisdom intent, the great state beyond thoughts. 

| The entranceway of pure wisdom dissolving into the nature of 
| original purity is like a snow lion poised on a snow peak. 

Thus, this indicates the measure of fearlessness and lack of anxiety that is 
achieved because awareness has arrived in its own place. 

| The impure entranceway of sarpsaradissolvinginto the entrance
| way of pure wisdom is like: gathering up the ropes that stake 
| down a tent. 

Thus, this is analogous to gathering [everything] within the sole vital 
essence. 

The key point for achieving liberation in this way is to abide in unim
peded empty awareness, as the nature of original purity, beyond thought 
and [229] expression. Having actually realized the ultimate ground oflib
eration, it is then necessary to encounter that which already is, decide 
upon that alone, and have confidence within liberation." Appearances 
by nature, when observed objectively, seem to be limitless; but, when 
observed subjectively, nothing whatsoever exists. However, even fixation 
upon the thought of nonexistence is naturally liberated in the first instant 
that one's own nature is nakedly revealed without mental analysis. This is 
the key point clearly defining the original ground of liberation. In what
ever way compassion engages with objects, do not try to stop this pursuit 
or hold this within. With awareness placed precisely upon its own source, 
[230] unimpeded cognition is without the distinctions of outer, inner, 
and between. In this way, the bardo appearances will be naturally pure in 
the radiance of awareness. This is a key point of the quintessential heart 
essence for recognizing the state of liberation with precise awareness. 
These three key points of upadcsha were left behind as my share of good 
fortune by the Omniscient Guru on the occasion when he went to the for
est ofChimpu. They are: 

| Cryptic and potent, concise and pithy, profound and of great 
| import: except for heart disciples, this upadesha must otherwise 
| be scaled in secrecy! 

So, scaled with the weight of his command, it will be difficult for others 
to understand this. 

Having discovered this from the vajra tantras-[ 2.31] although I 
have realized this [meaning] and many othcrs-ifl try to explain 
it to other beings, they will be incapable of comprehending or 
realizing this. Once again dissolving back into me, this will van
ish like waves emerging and dissolving into the ocean. 

Thus, he spoke. 

In brief, these revelations on the visions of spontaneous presence dis
solving in eight ways and so forth apply at any time in the bardo while 
securing the ground of one's own nature. Awareness is more exalted than 
the initial basis of confusion. One's own nature of phenomena is clear. The 
defining features of one's own discerning awareness are known. Liberation 
occurs in the domain of wisdom. [232] The result is not dependent upon 
the circumstance of another source. Wherever the inconceivable nature of 
phenomena is directly ascertained, that is known as ·me great ground of 
original liberation: In the Naturally Arising it states: 

| The ground of liberation is wherever the original ground abides. 

So, it is taught. 

If this is explained according to the nature, the aspect of outer clarity is 
like the light of a crystal dormant within. Having dissolved, yet not being 
obscured, is the nature of the dharmakaya. The intrinsic nature, clear and 
nonconceptual, is the basis for the arising of both aspects of riipakaya. 
The engaging of compassion is the inexhaustible ornamental wheel of the 
nature of enlightened body, speech, and mind of all sugatas. This nature of 
phenomena is able to arise in the minds of those to be tamed like how the 
reflection of the moon is able to appear in however many (z.33] vessels are 
filled with water. This is the way the ever-youthful vase embodiment of the 
dharmakaya abides. It states in the Ckar Expans~ 

| The nature of empty radiance is the kaya of wisdom. The intrin
| sic nature of compassion is without bias or direction. Great 
| inseparability is the primordial buddha. (87)

So, it is. Although manifestations do not diverge from the state of the 
ground of original purity, the riipakaya arises from the energy of the spon
taneously present ground of appearances. Those who believe in these tenets 
must understand this key point. 

The Sovereign of all Victorious Ones" also said that emanations do 
not manifest from the state of original purity, because the ground tran
scends the coarse appearances ofkayas and wisdom manifestations. [2.34] 
The emanations that manifest appear to actually accomplish the welfare of 
sentient beings. This will manifest from original purity as the arising of the 
appearance of the ground of spontaneous presence. 

When these manifestations occur on the path, there are two: the body
of the great transference and the natural nirmat)akaya, both of which 
appear to be other than the beings they are taming. One must recognize 
that, whenever emanations appear in the bardo, they benefit one's own 
appearances arising as sarpsara through the entranceway of spontaneous 
presence. Although the purpose of beings seems to be accomplished even 
in the dream state, it occurs merely as one's own appearances without actu
ally benefiting others. Since this is a key point concerning the exceptional 
tenets of the Great Perfection approach, [2.3s] it is somewhat difficult to 
comprehend. 

THE BARDO OF EXISTENCE 

Fourth, the bardo of existence is as follows. The outer body is now a men
tal body with all the sense organs and the ability to move about without 
obstruction. The inner mind has many notions that engage with anything. 
The combination of both body and mind c.an engage anywhere unimped
cdly with the exception of two places: the vajra scat and the mother's 
womb. Here, in general, the vajra scat of India" is the undeniably great, 
supreme power spot where the deed of enlightenment will be revealed 
by all the buddhas of this fortunate age. [236] If this place is obvious to 
most pure and impure beings, why would a magical body in the bardo 
that instandy arrives at any place that comes to mind be prevented from 
going there? If the answer is because of negative karma, then why can even 
groups of heretics and barbarians wander there these days without any 
difficulty? 

There is no cause or circumstance why the mental bodies spoken of 
here should be obstructed; yet because there is an object to be purified, 
the ground of liberation is obscured. The mother's womb is obstructed 
through the force ofkarma.lhc way of ascenaining the two places accord
ing to the assertion of the Sovereign of all Victorious Ones, Perna Ledrol,90 
[237] is that, although some ordinary teachers recognize the vajra seat to 
be Bodhgaya, India, here it refers to the inner space of unchanging origi
nal purity-the supreme place where all buddhas will be enlightened. This 
is the pure entranceway to enlightenment. The womb of the mother is the 
impure entranceway to sarpsara, including any birthplace of the six classes 
of beings. One should, therefore, know that these places are not meant to 
be taken literally. 

Furthermore, it can be understood that the beings of the bardo of
existence: arc: capable: of entering anywhere: unobstructc:dly, be it moun
tains, crags, or any of the: c:lc:mc:nts. That beings can enter crags, boulders, 
eggs, [238] the trunks of trees, and so forth is obvious to everyone. If they 
were to actually possess independent Ac:sh bodies and organs, it would 
contradict the meaning of a •mental body: Nc:vc:rthc:lc:ss, this is referred 
to as a "mental body" because they think they exist according to their own 
phenomena like the arising of dream appearances. It is taught: 
... those: who [are mental bodies] who have the corporeal form of 
their previous existence, with faculties complete, who are unim
peded, perceived by the same class and by those with the pure 
vision of the gods, and who are gandharvas unable to return. 

Thus, except for other bardo beings of the same class and those who have 
achieved the: eye: of the: gods, bardo beings cannot be: seen by anyone else
yet they can see all other beings in their respective places. [239] In bodies 
that are a collection of four names91 propelled by karmic winds and like 
feathers carried by the: breeze, they arc unable to find their own place to 
rest. Their state of mind is uncontrollable and uncertain, yet their power 
of memory is seven times keener than before. In that state of mind, they 
think, "I am dead"; and that thought alone is an overwhelming source of 
misery. At that interval, for however long the remaining time in the bardo 
is, the first half will be in the image of the body left behind and the second 
half in the: expression of the body of the future rebirth. However, if the 
place: of rebirth is to be: the formless realm, it is important to know that, 
because there is no form that will appear, nothing arises except emptiness. [240] 

In addition, even though one may have entered the path of Secret Man
tra, if the great samaya with the: vajra master has been corrupted, rebirth 
will be taken in vajra hell. Through the karma of having accumulated any 
of the: heinous nonvirtuc:s, including rejecting the dharma and so forth, 
one will directly descend [to the lowest rebirth]. If liberation occurs due: 
to realization, there will be a direct ascent. Those who have: accomplished 
powa will be: able to take rebirth anywhere: unimpededly, and the: bardo 
will cease. Others who were never introduced to this dharma91 or who were 
but had no confidence, impaired samaya, or failed to practice will experi
ence the: bardo of the nature of phenomena only briefly; and the opportu
nity for liberation will not occur.

For those in a state of perpetual reaction and fear, [241] me way in which 
they will relendessly wander in me bardo of existence is as follows. Every 
seventh day, the phenomena of rebirth and death will arise, causing intense 
suffering. That is why me strength of virtue through practice is increased 
every seventh day and the ceremonies performed for me deceased are so 
extremely beneficial. (93)

In general, it is taught that the longest period one remains in the bardo 
is forty-nine days, while the shortest is seven. Otherwise, it is also taught 
that, by force of virtue, a sudden transference may occur and, according 
to individual karma, the time in the bardo may be longer than usual. For 
instance, although the predetermined life expectancy may be one hun
dred years, in the desire realm there is also the unexpected circumstance 
of untimely death. [242] By ingesting pills that enhance the life force, it is 
also possible to extend the life expectancy. Nevertheless, analogous to the 
restoration of a defective irrigation canal by me insertion of a spout, at this 
time in the bardo with the miraculous ability to instandy arrive wherever 
wished, those who have seen this dharma94 will recognize the bardo; and, 
in that instant, the nirmil;lakaya pure realms of the ten directions wj]) 
be brought to mind. Then, by directing the mind [to those realms] with 
intense concentration, the habit of holding to the bardo of existence as a 
true experience will be purified. By the blessings of the truth of the nature 
of phenomena entering the stream of mind, the potential to take future 
rebirth (in sarpsara] will be exhausted. [243] By taking rebirth in these 
pure realms, enlightenment will be achieved! 

Otherwise, even if the truth of this dharma is not realized, as long as the 
bardo being is familiar with the wisdom kayas of the Great Yoga, then as 
Shantapun-fl-who possessed the eye of dharma-stated: 

| By the reversal of the clear light of sleep or death, once again 
| the consciousness of the basis of all emerges only as the arising 
| of mental activities, the mind of the dream state. A mental body 
| complete with all sense organs is attained similar to the instan· 
| taneous generation of the five fully purified states." In the man
| ner of generating the original protector, may the magical bardo 
| body arise as the sambhogakaya! 

Thus, one must bring this to mind. [244] 

At this point, for those who lack freedom, the signs that indicate a
connection with negative rebirth must be severed as stated in the Con· 
junction of the Sun and Moon: 

| [Bardo beings who are destined to become] gods and humans 
| will see the color white; titans and animals, yellow; deprived 
| spirits, light that looks like smoke; hell beings will see some
| thing similar to logs or shredded black wool; otherwise, animals 

| will see what looks like blood, and titans a downpour of rain. 

The orientation of the head is as the quote continues: 

| At this point, the head will be like this: gods and humans will 
| face upward; titans and animals will look straight ahead; and 
| deprived spirits and hell beings will face downward. These are 
| the signs of the future place of rebirth. [245] 

Thus, the: indications of the future place of rebirth in the six classes will 
arise as light, images, and other substantial appearances in the following 
way. If rebirth is to be taken in the higher realms, the bardo being will see 
white light about a mile long and his or her head will be facing upward. 
Those who will take impure rebirth in a lower realm as deprived spirits will 
sec smoke. Hell beings will see what appears to be a log or shredded black 
wool. Animals will see dark·colorcd blood, and titans will see a down· 
pour of sleet. The heads of [those destined to become] titans and animals 
will be oriented horizontally. Those of hell beings and deprived spirits will 
face downward. The differences should be carefully considered. Further· 
more, the [bardo being] who will become a god or human will actually sec 
that future place of rebirth. [2.46] Similarly, animals will see forests and 
islands, hell beings and deprived spirits will see dazzling flames of fire, and 
so forth. 

In brief. all those who will take rebirth in the desire realm will experience 
a yearning for objects. Those who will rake rebirth in the form realm will 
feel a yearning for light. Those who will be born in the formless realm will 
experience a yearning towards the mind in a state of nothingness. Wher· 
ever rebirth is to occur, the mind will constantly return to that place; and 
the yearning will continue to escalate while the consciousness goes there 
to rake a look. Haunted by terrifying appearances, the consciousness will 
see the place as a refuge; and the mind that wants to take shdter will, in a
split second of attachment, be reborn there. Because of the lack of a coarse 
physical support, [ 2.4 7] the desire to search for a body will be predomi
nant; but no matter how strongly that increases, great care must ensue so 
as to not enter a negative realm. 

Concerning the shortcomings of the future place of rebirth, in many of 
the commentaries written by well-known scholars and accomplished mas
ters, they do not explain that the signs just mentioned pertain to the future 
rebirth but rather that they are signs that occur afier conception such as 
gods feeling that they are in a celestial palace:, titans in a wheel of light, 
humans in a lovely dwelling place, and so forth. Understand that this is 
incorrect! It states in the: Conjunction of the Sun and Moon: 

| A fire wheel, a rainstorm or coldness, mist, many people nois
| ily crowded together, a temple or a multi-leveled house:, and a 
| tall house being constructed will be seen; [2.48] those destined 
| for the lower realms will see a thatched hut, a hole that dead
| ends, and a dry well. These are signs that a womb will be entered. 
| Although wishing to proceed, [the consciousness] is scaled, 
| trapped, and obstructed. 

Thus, this clarifies that point. 

Similar explanations given in the Ocean of Cloud Banks" [by the Omni
scient One:] tend to follow the works of previous scholars. Nevertheless, 
just as there are differences in the realization and abandonments while tra
versing the grounds, according to the perfected upadesha of the precious 
Treasury ofthe Supreme Vehicle, b those assertions [of previous scholars] are 
not accepted in the same way. 

Furthermore, according to some other explanations, if rebirth is to be 
taken in the eastern continent, the form of a goose will become appar
ent; [ 149] if in the northern continent, a fish. If rebirth is to be taken in 
the: western continent, a cow; and, if in the southern continent, the [con
sciousness] will see a male and female copulating. 

The best [practitioners] will abandon attachment, aversion, and jealousy 
and train to see that those appearances have no true, inherent existence. 

Middling practitioners will recall the practice during the time of empow
erment and, meditating upon the guru or meditation deity in union with
consort, by experiencing the secret empowerment, will embrace the path of 
empty bliss through the prajna empowerment. If they lack this potential, 
then in accordance with the teachings of the siitra classifications of bodhi
sattvas, they will rely upon the antidotes for reversing fixation such as the 
nine states of impure recognition towards desire and the rest. By bringing 
the pure realms to mind, [250] the entrance to the womb will be blocked 
and miraculous rebirth will occur within the heart of a lotus .flower in the
realms such as Manifest Joy, Great Bliss, and others. Although possessing 
weak diligence and considered to be of inferior faculties, from the stand
point of prajna, those who are able to recognize the key point of the path 
will seck rebirth in the support of the six elements," a human rebirth in the 
southern continent which is an exceptional support for attaining siddhis. 

The way one enters a womb endowed with the five glorious personal 
endowments and the five precious circumstantial endowments is as 
Shantapuri states: 

| The way the bardo body enters the mother's womb is to first 
| enter the body of the protector Alqhobhya. Through genera
| tion of the vajra mind [251] and the body's arrangement as a 
| mandala, the three doors arc purified and blessed. Meditating 
| on the arrangement of the three sattvas, the desirable quali
| ties of the consort are partaken of. Through familiarity during 
| the time of being awake, birth, death, and the bardo, may the 
| nirmanakaya rebirth be achieved! 

Thus, by gaining familiarity with this meaning at the present time, apply 
it when the time arrives. 

For inferior practitioners of the lowest capacity who have no dharma 
habit, it is as stated in the tantras: 

| For instance, like dry grass caught by fire, like being sucked into 
| quicksand, or tricked and trapped like a bird who alights on the 
| ground in pursuit of food, [the consciousness] is powerlessly 
| trapped through its own attachment. [252] 

Thus, due to the power of being caught as a bardo consciousness in 
the trap of the sexual union of father and mother, their act of copulation 
becomes the support for entering the womb. Of the limidess beings in the 
bardo of existence, those with karma will be like flies attracted to soiled 
meat in the summer and will enter through the lower orifice without any 
control. At that time, by praying to be reborn in a pure realm and taking 
refuge, the bardo being can dose the entranceway to negative rebirth. By 
choosing and directing the mind to an excellent rebirth, the bardo being 
will obtain a preciow human body with eighteen qualifications. Then, by 
meetiftg a virtu ow spiritual teacher who accepts one as a disciple, [ 153] lib
eration will be attained. 

This brief explanation and illumination of the process of the bardo is 
intended for those few individuals who, by the power of merit and time, 
have devotion for the heart essence and are inclined to practice. Knowing 
that it is rare for beings to flawlessly realize the: fundamental nature: and to 
have confidence: that they will be liberated during their life or at the time 
of death, it is my fervent prayer that there is still some chance: for libera
tion during these occasions.

FOR THOSE OF LESSER FACULTY 

The third general topic is the teaching on how to release the breath in 
the natural nirmanakaya pure realm for those of lesser faculties. Despite 
having directly encountered clear light in this way, there are those who 
squander their human life in a state of leisure, grow old and fail to internalize 
practice, [254] are never under the guidance of a precious guru while 
engaged on the path, still consider their own point of view superior to 
others, and experience nothing other than mental dation. [Such individ
uals] will receive no signs of progress on the path or any increase of the 
visions. Since their faculties are inferior even though claiming co practice 
the lineage of the Great Perfection, the individual has not attained the 
level of the Great Perfection so there is limited potential. 

However, if there is still faith in the dharma and a thin layer of non
virtue and one still possesses the karma to be able to transform a dream 
into a virtuous experience, then when arriving in the bardo of existence, 
where appearances are dreamlike, one will recognize them and think, "I 
have died." With faith and fervent regard for the guru as the foundation, 
[255] by bringing the guru to mind, the teachings received will be recalled. 
Since the bardo of the nature of phenomena was not previowly recognized 
and the power of truth undiscovered, one will recognize that one is still 
wandering in the bardo of existence. At the moment of thinking, "Now I
must go to a natural nirmanakaya pure realm" through the blessings of the 
nature of phenomena, one will be miraculously born in the heart of a lotus 
flower as it states in the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon: 

| By recalling the place of rebirth, all those of lesser faculties will 
| exhale their breath in a natural nirmanakaya pure realm. 

Thus, this oral instruction leaves nothing uncovered, is easily applied, and 
is endowed with great potential. 

In order to accomplish this, one must-in the present lifetime-have 
yearning faith for the guru from whom one has received upadesha, [256] 
coupled with direcdy observing one's own appearances during the day
time. Even when falling asleep at night, with intense concentration one 
must think, "I am dying so I must recognize the stages of dissolution and 
go to the natural nirmanakaya pure realm!" Then, one will fall asleep envi
sioning the arrangement and qualities of the nirmanakaya realm. Between 
[practice] sessions, as mentioned earlier, it is essential to have developed the 
skill of training the consciousness that rides the winds. This heart advice is 
given to those who have fear towards samsara and the lower realms. 

The explanation of the qualities of the nirmanakaya pure realms is as follows. [257]
In the great tantra Naturally Arising Awareness it states: 

| From here, in the eastern direction of this world system, is the 
| pure realm known as Manifest Joy. In this nirmaJJakaya pure 
| realm dwells the nirmaJ)akaya Vajrasattva. In this place, where all 
| of the sugatas have received sacred empowerment, the qualities 
| of the celestial palace are boundless. The palace itself is composed 
| of precious crystal, with four entranceways that possess jeweled 
| staircases. Even the ground is made entirely of precious crystal. 
| It is extremely pleasing and beautiful to behold. [258] There are 
| windows and skylights at the four entranceways through which 
| rays of the sun strike the precious crystal, creating an unceasing 
| array of five-colored rainbow-light prisms throughout the day
| time. Around the perimeter of the palace is a moat containing 
| water with the eight attributes of purity that has the power to 
| cure the disease or illness of anyone who drinks it. Along the 
| perimeter of [the moat] arc eight lagoons with many varieties 
| ofbirds singing melodiously. Among them, the sovereign bird is
| the golden swan, joined by wild ducks, kati birds, parrots [259] 
| who speak human languages, cuckoos, cranes, wild pheasants, 
| and the like. In total, there arc some eighty thousand classes of 
| song birds. The types of birds that are pleasing to behold are 
| vultures, hoopoes, phoenixes, and the birds of the gods, whose 
| voices sound like pealing bells. The vultures' bodies resemble 
| golden vajras. Some are blue like turquoise, while some are white 
| like a conch. Some: arc red like coral, while: others are green like 
| emerald. Their charming, melodious songs are inconceivably 
| wondrous. Encircling the periphery [260] is an iron fence made 
| of seven precious jewels. 

| In the center of all this is a dharma-teaching dais made of seven 
| precious gems, complete with cushions. It is here where the: 
| nirmaJ:takaya Vajrasattva is seated. In the evening, he teaches the: 
| causal path" to an assembly of disciples; while: at midnight, he 
| teaches the dharma of outer Secret Mantra. In the early hours 
| of dawn, he teaches inner tantra; and, at high noon, he teaches 
| the doctrine of the unsurpassed resultant path of the Great Per
| fection. In the course: of a day there arc: four teaching sessions, 
| and those in attendance are bodhisattvas who will definitely be 
| liberated in their next lifetime:. Their life expectancy is five hun
| dred and fifty years. 

| In this pure: realm [261] the: desire for food or drink is satis
| fied by the mere thought of it. Free of disease:, it is a place of 
| supreme bliss; and, even if an illness doc:s occur, it is dispelled by 
| drinking the: water of the eight attributes. There are multitudes 
| of flowers which everyone is offering in great abundance to the: 
| nirmaJ:takaya. In the four corners of the palace: are stiipas made 
| of pearls. Connecting these four are bells with hanging ringers 
| linked together by latticework cords. When the breeze blows 
| the cords, the various chimes of ringing bells can be: heard. In 
| the four directions arc: four banners made of various silks. [262] 
| When the breeze moves them, the flags emit a blend ofluscious 
| fragrances.

| This celestial palace is located to the cast about five hundred 
| miles above [this earth] in a place where the bodhisattvas who 
| arc born there enjoy endowments equal to the thirty-third level 
| of the gods. This is a description of the nirmiQakaya pure realm 
| of the eastern direction. 

Thus, likewise, the pure realms of the other three directions are under
stood to be similar except for a few subtle differences in terms of arrange
ment, life expectancy, abundance, and so forth. 

Other epithets for the support and supported pure realms arc men
tioned in the Gr~at Arrangmzent of Atf as follows:

| Endowed with Glory, [263] Lotus Arrangement, and Perfectly 
| Complete Activity are the fully perfected realms of Ratnasam
| bhava, Padma Garwang as Hayagriva, and Amoghasiddhi and 
| their retinues, whose cognitive-based obstructions have been 
| cleansed. The colors arc white, yellow, red, and green.

Thus, and in the center of all of these is the conqueror Sovereign of Form (99) 
abiding in the aspect of the maQ4ala of the wrathful deities, as it states in 
the Naturally Arising:

| In the region of space in front of these pure realms is the wrathful 
| nirminakaya pure realm known as the Great Charnel Ground of 
| the Blazing Ring ofFirc.b The celestial palace appears as follows. 
| [264] It is square and composed of skulls. The base is made of 
| dried skulls, the walls of sharari skulls. (100) The roofis composed of 
| overturned skulls complete with scalp and hair. The width and 
| height of the palace arc measureless. The nails arc made of mete
| orites, and blood descends from the roof gutters. The sun and 
| moon form the bases of the pillars. The capitals arc makaras,101 
| and the beams arc the eight great gods. The beams supporting 
| the cornice arc the Great Supreme One. (102) In the daytime, the 
| wind wails; and, in the nighttime, fires blaze. In the four direc
| tions of this celestial palace arc parasols of flayed humans. The
| five goddesses dance, and the entire ground of the support is a 
| turbulent ocean of blood. [265] Within this palace is the con
| queror Youthful Mighty Warrior." Although his wisdom intent 
| never wavers from enlightenment, he displays all the aspects of a 
| wrathful kaya. He is surrounded by coundcss c;lakinis and assem
| blies of wrathful deities. They include the c;lakini Completely 
| Pcaccful,b the Brahmin Conch-Necked One, the reishi Youthful 
| Moonlight," and their retinues of Dakkiniss, Ekajati and her six 
| siblings, the fourteen attendants, and the fifty-eight female ser
| vants. In addition, there arc coundcss c;lakinis in Ekajati reti
| nue, including one trillion attendants. [266] Members of the 
| retinue who have emanated from the conqueror's heart include 
| inconceivable wrathful mandalas such as Vajrapil)i and count
| less humans such as Garab Dorje and others. Turning the wheel 
| of the resultant doctrine of the unsurpassed Secret Mantra for 
| the retinue, all peaceful nirmanakaya bodhisattvas achieve lib
| eration. All of the deities possess the expressions of wrath, and 
| the celestial palace is immensely expansive.

Thw, it is. [267] 

The five pure realms where the great breath of liberation is taken arc as 
follows. Given that this is naturally arranged from the blessings of the con
queror Vajradhara, it is referred to as a ·natural nirmil)akaya pure realm: 
The cawc for those of fortunate karma to perceive this dirccdy is within the 
heart of the all-pervasive essence of the sugatas. That is the entranceway of 
the precious, spontancowly present. radiant appearance of the ground, the 
four wisdoms such as mirrorlike and the rest. As with the sambhogakaya, 
this has arisen as the natural clear light of the appearances of the path since 
bcginninglcss time and is designated as •cast• and the other directions. 
However, one should not consider that this exists as an ordinary direc
tion according to the common way of thinking. [ 168] If one thinks that 
explanations in terms of distance contradict this, the answer is that the dis
tance is far beyond the nature of the phenomena of the three realms. This 
is the reason for the reference [to direction]: however, it is not to be taken
literally. Similarly, although [it is stated that] the wrathful maQc;iala exists 
in the "upper regions," since the assembly of wrathful deities primordially 
abides in the palace of the cranium, that is where they arise. 

Furthermore, that which is called "intrinsic nature" refers to the intrin
sic nature of abiding, which is an emanation, and the intrinsic nature of 
enumerations for which there are two. This holds profound impon.ln the 
first case, this is as stated in the Smi oJS~cr~t Conduct' tantra: 

| Within the appearance of the nature as it is, the kayaofthe nature 
| as it is arises, [269] resembling oneself and one's reflection. 

Thus, from the resultant sambhogakaya which is like the face, the sam
bhogakaya of the nature of phenomena-like a reflection appearing in a 
mirror-arises as the path of the bardo perceived by all beings. Since this 
direcdy accomplishes the aim of the objects to be tamed, it is posited as the 
aspect of partial sambhogakaya. In terms of the latter, the appearance of 
the transcendent eleventh bodhisattva ground of Always Light is such that 
all bodhisattvas who are on the path hear the speech of the Buddha; but, 
because of their cognitive-based obstructions, they are still unable to see 
the kaya. When they are able to see the kaya, the cognitive-based obstruc
tions are fully exhausted so it is asserted that they will then achieve bud
dhahood. [270] This is a key point to be known by those who uphold the 
tenets of this lineage. 

These days, when the presence of the doctrine of the Great Perfection 
resembles the last rays at sunset, I have synthesized the essential points 
which illuminate the way ofbeing led to the ground of the resultant, spon
taneous presence of the three kayas. If one possessing prajfia truly aspires 
to comprehend the description of the intrinsic nature in its entirety, it can 
only be understood through the excellent speech of the Buddha, the words 
and syllables of which are superior and without any delusion. The secret 
nature of enlightened speech [271] is the sum total of all inconceivable 
qualities, and the blessings of this Wordb are undisputed. 

For a time in this land ofTibet, teachings like that of the great charioteer 
Nagarjuna-possessing the two qualities of protecting and guarding-as
well as many ocean! ike wisdom commentaries, excelled to the highest peak, 
leading all those who remained embodied to the citadel of great libera
tion. The chariot of the three categories, the wisdom commentaries, and so 
forth are ultimately spontaneously present as a great treasury of the inex
haustible ornamental wheel of the enlightened body, speech, mind, quali
ties, and activities of the victorious ones of the three times. Subsequendy, 
when the king of all vehicles [272] became threatened by the encroaching 
philosophical tenets of the unfortunate barbarians who resemble wild ani
mals, in order to annihilate them with the weapons oflogic and reasoning 
the excellent definitive words of the Seven Precious Jc:wds10J offered total 
protection, like the supreme fearless conduct of the master Dhannakirti. 

Thus, I entrust this to all of my disciples. 

| A follower of the exalted path, like the sun and the moon, whose  intelligence is stainless, 
| Gives excellent teachings which hold the ultimate result of  supremdy vast qualities like an udumwara• flower. 
| One who hears and fully understands this profound import will  cherish it like the crown jewel of the naga Icing's head. [273] 
| Such a person is a supreme vessel for the Great Perfection, a bodhisattva for whom rebirth in sarpsara has come to an end. 
| Based on the happiness and sorrow of this life's phenomena, it is  unbearable to consider the next life's existence-like the flashing tongue of a cobra. 
| In the extremely dense forest of self-fixation, the one who slumbers in ignorance will revolve on the wheel of existence wherever he goes. 
| The one whose mind conceptualizes existence cannot hope to cross to the shore beyond the four rivers. 
| Although the weight of many miseries is borne upon one's shoulders, jaded and without feeling, there is no commonality with the sacred guides. 
| Lacking the dharma eye of the three times, like a lotus lacking the moon, [274] even the long trunk of glory and wealth will support and provoke dormant tendencies that perpetuate sarpsara. 
| Whoever comes to know the nature of this elephant and goes on to accomplish the precious dharma will be the best among humankind! 
| There is no nonvirtue that eclipses anger; try to reverse it at the cost of your life. 
| Since there is no practice harder than patience, that is the: bodhisattvas' path. 
| By befriending the conduct of the six paramitis, such as noncon ceptual prajfia and the rest, it befits a great being to depart for an  extremely peaceful forest. 
| There, in an uninhabited place with a naturally formed cave and [275] in a forest of flowers where the sound of a cascading water fall can be heard, a sense of renunciation is invoked from within. 
| The birds and wild animals are harmless like the place ofBrahma of the four supports.104 
| May my body and mind abide in this way to accomplish the personal aim of actual awakening. 
| Beings, equal in number to the particles in the world system, have concepts equal to the sand in the great oceans. 
| Likewise, the taming powers of the dharma ocean are in harmony with this. 
| By the blazing glory of my activity, bringing all beings without exception to maturity, 
| Having pleased the ocean of victorious ones, 
| May I effortlessly merge with the ocean of the original inner space!

Although this treatise was originally requested by the Crazy One from 
Kong, Holder oflmmeasurable Qualities,• [276] and other sublime teach
ers, since the time for its dissemination had not yet arrived, it was sealed 
in the expanse of the ocean of <,lakin is. Whenever the emanation of the 
female keeper of mantra-powerful4akini Guardian oflmmortality, Tser
ingmab -proclaims the prophecy with the laughing sound of hi hi, the time 
for this dharma to benefit beings will have arrived. 

At the Mountain of Immortality, the learned scholar of perfect qualities,
Venerable Tendzin (Upholder of the Doctrine), offered a precious 
crystal mala of 108 beads and a golden flower to request [this teaching]. In 
he: Forest of Bodhi Trees called Tsering Jong [277] this was written by 
one: who totally relies on the blessings of Padma, Rangjung Dorje Jigmed
Lingpa, so that exhausted wanderers struggling in the: ocean of sarpsara can 
inhale the: breath of freedom. 

There are those who claim that, when the wind moves the reflection 
of the moon in a pond, children think the reflection is really the moon. 
Adults determine: that it is not the: moon moving but rather the: wind. They 
claim that the: water moon doesn't really exist. [Such a view] docs not exist 
in the: dharma teachings of the: state: of perfect awakening. [278] Therefore, 
during the time of degenerate views, even though sentient beings are con
trolled by their minds, at the: moment these: teachings arc: encountered, the 
unscrupulous mental activity of the: perpetual mountainlike view of exis
tence will collapse; and the interdependent existence of both the: person 
and phenomena will be: pacified in the: inconceivable space of the: Great 
Perfection! During the time of the five degenerations, may there: be the 
auspiciousness of never squandering the difficult-to-guard enlightened 
activity of the victorious ones!

Sarwa Mangalam Dzayantu Gto Gto Gto!
